    "# Lyric Generation with Recurrent Nerual Network #\n",
    "## Generating Dance Gavin Dance lyrics with machine learning ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for this project is the official [TensorFlow Tutorial - Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation). Since I am interested in generating song lyrics (instead of Shakespearean sonnets) I'm using a dataset of Dance Gavin Dance song lyrics that I scraped from the web. The web scraping program I wrote and the data itself, are [on my project repo](https://github.com/nurriol2/dgd_lyric_generation). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some great ideas for improving the model are given in [Jason Brownlee's post on text generation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/). I implemented a few of these suggestions throughout this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I intend for this noteboook **to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are several resasons I chose Google Colab:\n",
    "1. Even with only a few epochs, my laptop cannot train a model quickly\n",
    "2. Google Colab does not require any installations (Python or otherwise) to get started programming\n",
    "3. The errors I had running the same code with AWS and Spell, simply, do not exist when using Google Colab  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a powerful GPU or would like to try running this code on your own machine or somewhere besides Google Colab, everything is available on the project repo - including a `requirements.txt` file. If you do use a different platform to explore this project, I would love to hear about it! "
