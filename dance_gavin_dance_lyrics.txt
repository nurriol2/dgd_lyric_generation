[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Do you crave a greater reason to exist?
Have you always known that symmetry is bliss?
We know you see the pattern
Lay in your lap, think of your path
Philosophy don't bother me, come back when you're trash
You are welcome here but you must come alone
You know everything is everywhere is home
Do you see it?

[Chorus: Tilian]
Prisoner, prisoner
We found you
We feel you breathing
Are you there?
Can you hear us calling you?
We'll never judge you

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tillian]
Run out of battery
Learn how to patronize
You gotta obtain, sustain, that guy
No time to make a deal today
We just push that other guy outta the way
Nothing's in a vacuum
Space-time has no value
We're all connected on this wave

[Chorus: Tilian]
Prisoner, prisoner
We found you
We feel you breathing
Are you there?
Can you hear us calling you?
We'll never judge you

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
They spoke with potent pain
To all that's broken
To tears in rain
But every side was the same
No coin to flip

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Give yourself a medal, you just met the devil
You're the last in the world to find another false god
Give yourself a medal for dancing with the devil
You're the last in the world
Come back down to crippling doubt
Well, Billy backs abortion and eye cream
Smokes a pack of Christian Bale and fucks on an island
Well, smooth as oscillation of sine waves
Get off the high horse and fly the spy plane
Classic acid, put me back in the casket
Weave me into the fabric
The filter is freaking out

[Verse 1: Tilian]
I need to take some time off, focus on my brand
Learn to love myself for who I am
Find my destiny written in sand
And let it all go to my head

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
See, I feel my slit get wrist tight
Written on my mitten
Feeling angry, go-go, night-night
Me go feed the pigeons
Well, some of you guys asked about
How I fit this in my mouth
Well, there's a link below my pout
Entrepreneurs rule, yeah

[Chorus: Tilian]
It was real, real nice to meet you
Hope you learned what I had to teach you
Got my chips stacked up to beat you, beat you
If the world doesn't defeat you
If the mob doesn't delete you
Nobody even really needs you anyway

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Remember when we felt alive?
No, I don't think so
Remember when we almost died?
That never happened
Remember when you tried to kiss her
But she was gay and liked your sister?
I don't remember at all, I guess sometimes lyrics lie

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Read some Plato, Faulkner, read some Rand
Photos on Mount Fuji in Japan
Went to Paris, Rome, and Kyrgyzstan
And let it all go to my head
Now I'm all cultured and educated
Quite qualified to be the one that made it
I've got what it takes to inspire you

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Some of you guys asked about
How I fit this in my mouth
There's a link below my pout
Entrepreneurs rule, yeah

[Chorus: Tilian]
It was real, real nice to meet you
Hope you learned what I had to teach you
Got my chips stacked up to beat you, beat you
If the world doesn't defeat you
If the mob doesn't delete you
Nobody even really needs you anyway

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Remember when we felt alive?
No, I don't think so
Remember when we almost died?
That never happened
Remember when you tried to kiss her
But she was gay and liked your sister?
I don't remember at all, I guess sometimes lyrics lie

[Bridge: Tilian]
Sorry, didn't mean to flex
Just sit back down and learn from the best
I was born with a silver spoon
Feeding me pure fortitude
Confidence and stamina
I'm focused like a camera
I am, I'm a goddamn animal
Oh, everything comes natural

[Chorus: Tilian & Andrew Wells]
It was real, real nice to meet you (Real, real nice to meet you)
Hope you learned what I had to teach you
Got my chips stacked up to beat you, beat you
If the world doesn't defeat you (World doesn't defeat you)
If the mob doesn't delete you
Nobody even really needs you anyway

[Intro: Tilian]
Te adoro, mi reina
Eres la única que veo
Te adoro, mi reina
Eres la única que amo

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Dust in the wind still laying in the chalk, nothing to do
Faking amends when it's hard to be the boss of your own abuse
I've been wishing I went missing, it's okay to pray
Why am I listing what need fixing when God won't operate?

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Tus caderas curan la enfermedad
Tu trasero trae paz mundial

[Chorus: Tilian]
La forma en que te mueves
Resuelve el calentamiento global
La forma en que te mueves
Resuelve el calentamiento global

[Post-Chorus: Tilian]
Te adoro, mi reina
Eres la única que veo
Te adoro, mi reina
Eres la única que amo

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
History repeats itself
I guess I smelt what I dealt
Emblem emblazed above the head, I'm your avatar
Lethal idealist, expectations of bliss
Know perfection, man, I cradled the reservoir

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Tus caderas curan la enfermedad
Tu trasero trae paz mundial

[Chorus: Tilian]
La forma en que te mueves
Resuelve el calentamiento global
La forma en que te mueves
Resuelve el calentamiento global
La forma en que te me muestres
Resuelve el calentamiento global

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Barely in bed and then your head starts making
Thoughts you thought you could ignore
I need to be fed, that's what my trash can's saying
Dresser cries for better drawers
Knives start to think 'bout the cuts that they do
No sharper thinking will slice up the truth
Si pudiera embotellar tu ritmo
Y venderlo como bebida
El mundo se libraría de la locura, locura

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Ah, Tilian
Make it stop, yeah, make it stop, yeah
I need off, I hate when I'm bad
Make it stop, yeah, make it stop, yeah
House wants your chores
Si todos vieran en el otro lo que yo veo en ti
La disonancia se derretiría en armonía (Armonía)

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Got to the bottom of the fallout, now you're back in my arms
We didn't listen to the mission, now we're back in a spar
You couldn't take another second, now you're back in the car
Another minute right back in it and we're falling apart

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I guess I'm still learning that your brain is bizarre
And maybe I'm a little crazy, but I won't break your heart

[Chorus: Tilian]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Multiple stab wounds
Multiple stab wounds, yeah
Multiple stab wounds
Multiple stab wounds, yeah

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I won't tame you
I won't fade your shine
Won't restrain you
I won't break your stride
Only eight editions of the limited left
Authentic, new and precious, I'm completely obsessed
My mouth is open wider than the time I had sex
I knew you'd do this, you're awesome, bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I make offbeat noises with my little guitar
Always been a little crazy, but I don't think too hard

[Chorus: Tilian]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Don't think too hard)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Multiple stab wounds
Multiple stab wounds, yeah
Multiple stab wounds
Multiple stab wounds, yeah

[Chorus: Tilian]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I guess I'm still learning that your brain is bizarre
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Another minute right back in it and we're falling apart

[Bridge: Tilian]
I won't tame you
I won't fade your shine
Won't restrain you
I won't break your stride
I won't tame you
I won't fade your shine
Won't restrain you
I won't break your stride

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(Only eight editions of the limited left)
I won't tame you
(Authentic, new and precious, I'm completely obsessed)
I won't fade your shine
(My mouth is open wider than the time I had sex)
Won't restrain you
(I knew you'd do this, you're awesome, bitch)
I won't break your stride

[Intro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
If you'd just wait for us
To return to where it came from
Just wait for us
You'd be young again

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Heal my demons
Make it dirty on principle
Kill my prison, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Tip my demons
But I know they're unquenchable
Kill my prison, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Now do what's suggested, become a bad father
Act famous, ask some woman to prepare you food
But you can't even use a computer
Talk like you invented dirt, then predict the future

[Chorus: Tilian]
Heal my soul 'cause I'm one in a million
Be underwater 'til the end of time
I need a miracle to change my mind
I'm underwater, drowning 'til you
Heal my soul 'cause I'm one in a million

[Post-Chorus: Tilian]
Get straight, dominate
Dictate faith, don't tolerate
You gotta concentrate, conglomerate
(Hallelujah)

[Interlude: Tilian & Jon Mess]
If you'd just wait for us
To return to where it came from
Just wait for us
You'd be young again

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Heal my demons
Make it dirty on principle
Kill my prison, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Tip my demons
But I know they're unquenchable
Kill my prison, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Looking through the lens with that malfunction
Night time seems so far away
Globes are spinning half as round
The feeling that we found was contagious

[Chorus: Tilian]
Heal my soul 'cause I'm one in a million
Be underwater 'til the end of time
I need a miracle to change my mind
I'm underwater, drowning 'til you
Heal my soul 'cause I'm one in a million

[Post-Chorus: Tilian, Tilian & Jon Mess]
Get straight, dominate
Dictate faith, don't tolerate
You gotta concentrate, conglomerate
Hallelujah
(Get straight, dominate)
(Dictate faith, don't tolerate)
(You gotta concentrate, conglomerate)
Hallelujah

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
All my anxious fear
It's not that I'm gone, I was never here
All my anxious fear
Heal my soul 'cause I'm one in a million
I was never even here

[Intro: Tilian]
We feel this way
Hiding from our pain and our mistakes
Vibrate the shame
Let these dirty veins go all the way

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I must be the worst and the best
'Cause the hole in my chest
Yeah, they think it’s impressive
If art has to feel like this, do I parody catharsis?
Average things don't have a place
You starve, you stay in budget
Once I got what they want
They act like they don't want it

[Pre-Chorus: Will Swan]
Uh, got a leg up
Know when to sit down, when to get up
Uh, got a leg up
I killed the whole game, now I’m fed up

[Chorus: Tilian]
Don't wanna be a shoulder to cry on
Don't turn the light on, don't tell me your name
I know you're hurting, but at the same time
I need to numb my blood 'til I'm okay
As the world is crumbling down, I'm falling in love
Don’t need your politics, I’m focused
As the world is turning 'round, I’m cutting a rug
Don't need your common sense, I'm focused

[Refrain: Tilian]
We feel this way
Hiding from our pain and our mistakes
Vibrate the shame
Let these dirty veins go all the way

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I must be the worst and the best
'Cause the hole in my chest

If art has to feel like this, do I parody catharsis?

Once I got what they want
They act like they don't want it

[Pre-Chorus: Will Swan]
Uh, got a leg up

[Chorus: Tilian]
Don't wanna be a shoulder to cry on
Don't turn the light on, don't tell me your name
I know you're hurting, but at the same time

As the world is crumbling down, I'm falling in love
Don't need your politics, I'm focused
As the world is turning 'round, I'm cutting a rug
Don't need your common sense, I'm focused

[Bridge: Tilian]
This is where you blame it on the weather
Or blame it on the devil
Or blame it on whomever
You suck already
This is where you blame it on the weather
Or blame it on the devil
Or blame it on whomever
You suck either way

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I can't believe this, I'm a fetus, I'm a baby boy
My height decreases, I can't reach the counter, find my toys
Once gave speeches, now they're screeches, what can I destroy?
I'm not lazy, I'm just baby tiny baby boy

[Intro: Tilian]
I'm lost again
Where have my friends all gone?
Been chasing stars so long
That home feels like a distant memory
Guess I can turn my woes into familiar melodies

[Verse 1: Jon Mess, Tilian, both]
Hey, I wanna set up shop
Reach in and grab that mop
Clean up the past, say I'm sorry
Hey, I wanna eat my fear
Fingers, they go in ears
La-la-la-liberated
Ten thousand words cling to photos of memories
Can't tell what hurts, but you know I'm the enemy

[Refrain: Tilian]
Everybody sins, everybody's volatile
Everybody doubts decisions when they're vulnerable
Nobody's perfect, but everyone's searching, I'm sure

[Chorus: Tilian]
Roll the windows down, let the breeze blow heavy
Turn the music loud, let the fever come alive
Gotta feel that sound when the blood pumps steady
Can't drag you down, come alive

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers

[Verse 2: Tilian]
They say don't get caught up in regret, learn from
Everything you've lost, let go of all you've done

[Refrain: Tilian]
Everybody sins, everybody's volatile
Everybody doubts decisions when they're vulnerable
Nobody's perfect, but everyone's searching, I'm sure

[Verse 3: Jon Mess, both]
Hey, I wanna set up shop
Reach in and grab that mop
Clean up the past, say I'm sorry
Hey, I wanna eat my fear
Fingers, they go in ears
La-la-la-liberated

[Chorus: Tilian]
Roll the windows down, let the breeze blow heavy
Turn the music loud, let the fever come alive
Gotta feel that sound when the blood pumps steady
Can't drag you down, come alive

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers
I want you to matter to you
Forget those backstabbers

[Outro: Tilian]
If you feel your feelings
Let the feelings heal your fucked up mind
Put your palms to the sky
And if you need some healing
Let the feelings open up your mind
Put your palms to the sky
If you feel your feelings
Let the feelings heal your fucked up mind
Put your palms to the sky
And if you need some healing
Let the feelings open up your mind
Put your palms to the sky

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Only bangers from now on
Only angry mental moans
You fool, I'm rich
Splattered the bag
Emptied the crypt
You fool, I'm rich
Flap like a flag
Scripted to flip

[Verse 1: Tilian]
How long could you keep up with all of it?
Before you jacked too many licks
And caught something you couldn't kick? (Couldn't kick?)
It's no surprise you came and begged me for a second chance
Pathetic hat in hand, now that I'm in demand

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Give me substance, give me something

[Chorus: Tilian]
This is the song you wish you'd wrote
Before you proved to the world you're a fucking joke
Before you had your chance and fucking choked
Before you tried to do me over
Honestly you've always known I'd prevail
It's biology and you were born to fail

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Facts, just say it
No, you don't need to know
Feels, display them
Everyone's the goat
Now I'm around the world
Shredding for a full ovation
And you can trash my reputation
As you enjoy your long vacation

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Give me substance, give me something

[Chorus: Tilian]
This is the song you wish you'd wrote
Before you proved to the world you're a fucking joke
Before you had your chance and fucking choked
Before you tried to do me over
Honestly you've always known I'd prevail
It's biology and you were born to fail

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
Ditch it fist bastard
Cancel all your fans
They're passed out in the pasture
Sucking up the spam
You look just like a person
But missing all the man
When life becomes a burden
Just pull a fucking scam

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
You were born to fail
Goddamn
You were born to fail
Just pull a fucking scam
You were born to fail
Goddamn
You were born to fail
Just pull a fucking scam

[Intro: Tilian]
I live alone, die alone
I'm my own boss
Turn my phone off, on my throne
Catch me at home
I live alone, die alone
I'm my own boss
Turn my phone off, on my throne
Catch me at home

[Verse: Jon Mess]
But the stakes are higher now
I'm all trimmed up on a diet now
But the stakes are higher now
They want milk from the finest cow
Bang, bang on the door, who's there? (I'm scared)
Let's see what we can do
I love myself and I love you too

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Can't fight that fluid feeling, no
Can't force that juice

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Damn ho, you can rob me, I gave up getting paid
Rambo mixed with Rodney, I'm cracked out in a cave
Damn ho, you can rob me, I gave up getting paid
Rambo mixed with Rodney, I'm cracked out in a cave

[Post-Chorus: Tilian]
I just need a little bump
To tap into that higher flow
I just need a little bump
To keep me afloat
I just need a little bump
To tap into that higher flow
Same thing that got me here
Barely keeps me afloat

[Bridge: Tilian]
This new humility and gratitude
Robs me of my fantasies
(Robs me of my fantasies, oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're all philosophers, our platitudes (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Covering up our jealousy (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Covering up our jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy)

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Damn ho, you can rob me, I gave up getting paid
Rambo mixed with Rodney, I'm cracked out in a cave
Damn ho, you can rob me, I gave up getting paid
Rambo mixed with Rodney, I'm cracked out in a cave

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Why don't you stop? Why don't you quit?
You'll never get better, you'll never get over it
Why don't you quit? Why don't you quit?
You'll never get better, you'll never get over it
Why don't you stop? Why don't you quit?
You'll never get better, you'll never get over it

[Intro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
When your apathy's gone sadistic
And you've discarded truth
All of your work is worthless
And you're dancing with doom
Your ego runs rampant
And tells you you're screwed
So I tried to watch the witness
And I found out I'm you
(Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-ah)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
We got addicted to the "What could go wrong?"
I think I'm living right if you just play along
We got addicted to our lonesome theme song
Plans for the planet, we're done, run

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I'm your prison, won't you listen?
Give me back your pride

[Chorus: Tilian]
Don't depend on me
A let-down forever
Stop defending me
We'll go down together
Don't depend on me
A let-down forever
Stop defending me
We'll go down together (Go down together)
We'll go down together (Go down together)

[Refrain: Jon Mess & Tilian]
When your apathy's gone sadistic
And you've discarded truth
All of your work is worthless
And you're dancing with doom
Your ego runs rampant
And tells you you're screwed
So I tried to watch the witness
And I found out I'm you
(Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-ah)

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
It won't need us right after we've fed
It enough, let's just hope it's our dad
You think a genius got shit on this lad
Load up the lantern and let there be

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Unconditionally dependent
Love is hard to find

[Chorus: Tilian]
Don't depend on me
A let-down forever
Stop defending me
We'll go down together
Don't depend on me
A let-down forever
Stop defending me
We'll go down together (Go down together)
We'll go down together (Go down together)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
You're just in denial and with the wrong one
Love don't make you crippled or enslaved
You're just in denial and with the wrong one
Job description ain't the one who saves

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I can still see my former reflection
Behind my new complexion
I just need to be alone
Why do people stare? Are they noticing you're there?
Swap me for my clone and don't touch me when I'm stoned

[Chorus: Tilian]
I'll be my old self again soon
I just need time to unwind
Smash my demons with cold fiction
Until they're all catechized

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I need reminded, recognize it, thinking doesn't know
Another night, another night, another night alone
Minimize or dramatize, it stops, it starts, it goes
'Nother night, another night, and no one even knows

[Refrain: Tilian]
Did you notice I'm normal?
Did you notice I'm normal?
Take a look, babe, I'm normal
Did you notice I'm normal?

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
You're just in denial and with the wrong one
Love don't make you crippled or enslaved
You're just in denial and with the wrong one
Job description ain't the one who saves

[Breakdown: Jon Mess]
Uh, uh, hi
How do I say hi to another guy when I wanna die?
Why? Uh, hi
Why don't you say hi? We're all alive
I guess that's nice, don't wanna die
Hi, it's nice to be alive, don't wanna die
You should say hi, I won't lie
Hi, but first, I'm saying hi to say I tried to stay alive
Who the hell's recording this?
I never gave my full consent
There's sounds I make I can't defend
Or show them to my mom

[Bridge: Tilian]
Did you notice I'm normal?
Did you notice I'm normal, normal?
Did you notice? (Did you notice?)

[Refrain: Tilian]
Did you notice I'm normal?
Did you notice I'm normal?
Take a look, babe, I'm normal
Did you notice I'm normal?

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I grapple, I paddle, I clutch
More thinking, more sinking, more mud
How many holes have I dug?
More thinking, more sinking, more mud
(Mmm)

[Intro: Tilian]
Take, all you do is take
You can have it all
Caught, in your web, I'm caught
Catch me when I fall
Stare, kill me with your stare
All I do is follow
Care, do you even care
If I'll be there tomorrow?

[Chorus: Tilian]
A medical dependency to you
There's nothing shameful that I wouldn't do
A medical dependency to you
There's nothing shameful that I wouldn't do

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I must've killed that shit
I shoulda stayed in Florida
Too much I spent
My shape got bent
I'm just a corny cracker
I spilled my beans
'Cause I'm a fiend
I lost my extra mustard

[Interlude: Tilian]
Oh, undertow, undertow
Undertow, under

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
All those thoughts you think don't even matter
Punch yourself, punch you in the face
All those thoughts you think don't even matter
If you don't care, you don't have to say

[Bridge: Andrew Wells]
So take me for granted (Granted)
I know I never really meant that much to you
All our memories will be erased
The only way out is forward
As far away as I can get
Where to now?
What happened to my fucking purpose?
I am just a stone sinking, broken and numb
Where to now?
The way you made me, made me worthless
Truth is in the end, we all end up alone
Can you feel me
Calling your name from the balcony seats you left empty?
Can you feel me
Tearing apart everything we used to be?

[Refrain: Tilian]
Take, all you do is take
You can have it all
Caught, in your web, I'm caught
Catch me when I fall
Stare, kill me with your stare
All I do is follow
Care, do you even care?
If I'll be there tomorrow?

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Don't forget to clap for plants
A napkin allergy, a skin graft treatment
Tried out comedy, got ants in my pants
Rolled out my linen, two bats, scrap

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
A medical dependency to you
There's nothing shameful that I wouldn't do
A medical dependency to you
There's nothing shameful that I wouldn't do

[Intro: Tilian]
Surrender
Surrender
My walls melt in your gaze
Your sunshine clears the haze
Surrender

[Verse 1: Johnny Franck]
Am I good enough for your love?
Make me believe that everything is good
Don't shoot a hole up in the sun
Turn it to gold and make it happy again
I feel it cut on my teeth
Don't let it shatter all around me

[Chorus: Tilian]
Do you really wanna stay? Do you really wanna stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself, walking cliché?
Do you really wanna stay? Do you really wanna stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself? Are you okay?

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Oh, awesome
They're pimping out the poorest
Forget about some forest, ignore it
We're either getting saved or getting fucked
The quantum shit they're building, man
You can't even understand
The possibilities are dropping in

[Refrain: Jon Mess]
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around, get stuck

[Verse 3: Will Swan]
Climb that ladder, ass don't matter
Drip Mad Hatter, watch it burn
Brew the earth up and put it in an urn
Light that bitch up, spin it, watch it turn
Feels good to be the last generation
Cuttin' Xans in a space station
I'm not fuckin' cryin' while I'm waiting
Let the world end, nigga, I'm patient

[Chorus: Tilian]
Do you really wanna stay? Do you really wanna stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself, walking cliché?
Do you really wanna stay? Do you really wanna stay?
Do you even know you've lost yourself? Are you okay?

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
The future, no one's famous
We're just a giant ass
Cheeks are made of children
Old was just a fad
Shit on all the billions
Version stupid crap
Hive named D.Y.L.A.N
Don't you love a nap?

[Refrain: Jon Mess]
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
Stick around, get stuck
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around, get stuck

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
(Leaving the world behind)
(Happiness undefined)
(Leaving the world behind)
You're a clown now, you're a clown now
Stick around, get stuck

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
What are we to ever do? My mind is lead and you're a wall
The lion's den of I'm akin to sleeping late and eating wrong
Well if I ever got it straight, I think I'd bend at every pause
The action leaking out my face, from breathing paint to missing calls
Well I'm the sugar-coated tooth, and I have come to ruin your mood
While staring at the frozen foot, I realized I'm stupid too
Well farming isn't fun at all, and I will build a thousand malls
And eat the food court's flesh, from every single city

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Before you ask what you think you want to know
Take a look at my face and how far you think I'll go
Because I've had it up to here for the 37th time this year
And I've kept it bottled down
But not this time, not here
'Cause I'm fucking on one

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Shave it out, you need a break from hair
Coming out bald, I'm the eagle in the air
With the big ass braids and the folding chair
Just shave it out, you need a break from hair

[Verse 4: Tilian]
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over
I feel the marrow in my bones
Heart is beating, heavy breathing
Can't stop me when I'm in my zone
Blood is colder, taking over

[Verse 5: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Set it up, cover the plans, record everyone, make demands
Positional strategy, split was disastrous, flanking the siege
You've seen me arrive, shed my disguise
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
Keep it alive, fight to survive
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to

[Outro: Tilian, Jon Mess]
(Bit by bit I recover from this)
You've seen me arrive, shed my disguise
(Cleanse my palette and validate my gifts)
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to
(Little by little, remove myself from the middle)
Keep it alive, fight to survive
(Stick it to the man till they bones is brittle, aware?)
I thought you wanted to, I thought you wanted to

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Back to sloth and sleeping binges
Self-defeating outburst cringes
Thoughts get rusty, creaky hinges
Lost that box of clean syringes
Stuck to the ceiling, I'm in view
Can't shake the notion I'm becoming you
The look from above, same as below
Sign up for high, free dose of low
The Jig is up, I'm the one, manipulate the ones I love
Light my path, reveal the beacon, where's my balance?
Can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking
Stop

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
(Searching for substance)
I lose control of my autonomic mind
(Waiting for the impulse)
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
(Your thoughts intangible)
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
(Around the winding road)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl, don't be so difficult
Come here, let's get physical

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Sinus pressure, getting older
I like weight upon my shoulders
Here I live, inside this CD
Tell your friends he's super creepy
Weirded out a simple human
Confused by words, arrange and move them
Into spaces, apparent meaning
Eat this song, your ears are greedy

[Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Cut out this conversation, desperation
Now, losing admiration, holding onto accidents
(I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim)
What have I done, what have I done?
(I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm)
That calls for your attention?
(I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim)
What have I done, what have I done?
(I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm)
That keeps you hanging on?

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
(Searching for substance)
I lose control of my autonomic mind
(Waiting for the impulse)
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
(Your thoughts intangible)
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
(Around the winding road)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl, don't be so difficult
Come here, let's get physical

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Who drains the blood from my head? (I do, I do)
Who comes through with the meds? (I do, I do)
Blackened seeds, you're gonna needs these, freeze
The common ancestor, the pressure of industry
Who sleeps in the grease crease
Wax and trails of mutual deceit
I heard that growth was gettin weak
Who taps the line, records my mind
Twisted agenda, align my spine
Whose got the steeples, the people and scepters
The rocks on the beaches, the angles, the vectors
Who drains the blood from my head? (I do, I do)
Who accepts me as I am? (I do, I do)

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Relationships are a tool that can fuel the facade over my disguise
Fulfill my ego, I do what I do with unrelenting compromise
When it's all on the table, you know I'll be able
To duck, dodge, and run, and hide
Got a good education in disinformation
Adept at constructing lies

[Verse 3: Jon Mess, Tilian]
The crack on the staircase, I smoked out of boredom
(And I will get it all on my own)
My kitchen is filled with meat and chloroform
Squirming colors metastasize
(And I will get it all on my own)
Upon viewing the world the fetus eats its own eyes

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
Acting the fiction and signing the right away
Transistor electrocute, wiping the order away
Awkward offensive hold, perfectly natural
They can't speak 'bout my brand, because I'm dead and white
Acting the fiction and signing the right away
Transistor electrocute, wiping the order away
Awkward offensive hold, perfectly natural
They can't speak 'bout my brand because I'm dead and white

[Verse 5: Tilian]
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid
I'm the one, I'm the one
With my hands around the gun
I am not afraid, I am not afraid

So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)
So what (I'm the one, I'm the one)
I'll die (with my hands around the gun)
Alone, alright (I am not afraid, I am not afraid)

[Outro: Will Swan]
Woke up in a new Bugatti (Then I burned it)
Woke up next to Jodi Arias (She my hood bitch)
Double it down on all the clowns trying to remake DBM
(Man, you crazy)
We started this sound from Sac Town
Bitch, you best be home by 10 (Curfew bitch)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
This is my brand, and I charge you the fee
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
I jumped inside the blender, now drink me
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Rage against the reflection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Buy this shit-stained product infection
Bathing in the glory, I love my story
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory
Wax and wane, and wax and wane, I wanna soak up the glory

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Yeah, turn on my right hand (that's my trope)
Yeah, turn on my right hand (that's my trope)
You know the price ain't right and if I spin this hype
Then I'm award-winning actor man
Yeah, turn on my right hand
Push with your clout, pull the mud out your mouth, man
I'm only christening what's mine
You come back once and then the second time for blood

[Chorus 2: Tilian]
I'm terribly wasted
You're coming to pieces
Let's get fucking naked
And fall off the deep end

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
That's my trope and my sleight of hand
I'm about to predict the future
Any credit given will be swept under the rug
Or reduced to the fine print
I'm only silent when you're asking questions
The simple answer is "No, I wasn't present"
All I see is an ocean of replicas
All I see in their eyes is my reflection

[Bridge: Tilian Pearson]
The world's a stage and I'ma wax and wane
Like the moon till they're lit like the sun
The world's a bitch and I manipulate it
You'll believe every word I say

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Yeah, turn on my right hand (that's my trope)
Yeah, turn on my right hand (that's my trope)
You know the price ain't right and if I spin this hype
Then I'm award-winning actor man
Yeah, turn on my right hand
Push with your clout, pull the mud out your mouth, man
I'm only christening what's mine
You come back once and then the second time for blood

[Chorus 2: Tilian]
I'm terribly wasted
You're coming to pieces
Let's get fucking naked
And fall off the deep end

[Chorus 1: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural
What I had in mind was what you held against me
Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane, take apart your brain
If you ever loved me (If you ever loved me)
Never satisfied or just never coming back

[Chorus 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]
(Stay away from me)
No, prep him for the ghost
Let him see the ghost
(Stay away from me)
Let it in and come to terms
With what would have, could have been
(Stay away from me)
Prep him for the weight
Let him see the fate
(Stay away from me)
Fracturing relationships and isolation

[Verse 1: Tilian Pearson]
Do you wanna get mad about
All your feelings won't change the world
Do you wanna get mad about
Saying nothing, being nothing, be with someone else

[Chorus 1: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I'll have to leave just as soon as the colors begin to fade
I'll run away before lying to you becomes natural
What I had in mind was what you held against me
Give me the keys and I'll drive you insane, take apart your brain
If you ever loved me (If you ever loved me)
Never satisfied or just never coming back

[Chorus 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]
(Stay away from me)
(Stay away from me)
(Stay away from me)
No, prep him for the ghost
Let him see the ghost
(Stay away from me)
Let it in and come to terms
With what would have, could have been
(Stay away from me)
Prep him for the weight
Let him see the fate
(Stay away from me)
Fracturing relationships and isolation

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Before you decide that this is dated
Take me out of the equation
What was it that you most hated?
All the time that you spent waiting
When the stomach becomes the mouth
And it's spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking
Would prevent you from the point you're making
When the stomach becomes the mouth
And it's spewing all its garbage out
To think before speaking
Would prevent you from the point you're making

[Outro: Jon Mess]
The slew of trails towards destiny
The perfect day to quit
The slew of trails in reverie
Bite my crooked shape

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

[Chorus 3: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
It's all that I see

[Chorus 4: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never fold under pressure
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there
Never mind how I got there

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

[Chorus 3: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
It's all that I see

[Chorus 4: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never fold under pressure
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there

[Chorus 1: Tilian Pearson]
I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me

[Verse 1: Tilian, Jon Mess]
You go there and I'll go too
I'll be the one that follows you
Watch you sleep and watch you wake
Notice all the moves you make
Be your rock, I'll be your guide
Without you it's suicide
Can't wait til the day we meet
Until then I'll watch you sleep

[Chorus 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

[Chorus 1: Tilian Pearson]
I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
I've got the sickest picture of you in my mind
I get the strangest urges all of the time inside
Take part in this demonstration, rope mixed with wine
I hope to follow through with you cause the timing's right

[Verse 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Stuck inside the living room
Tangled faces, glow in tune
Commenting is hardly rude
I can't monitor what I consume
Body count competition
Childhood memory demolition
Slap your wrist, accept the sentence
Ain't my fault if I'm irrelevant

[Chorus 2: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Put it in my fist and squish 'n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Put it in my fist and squish 'n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Cancel my vacation, I'm on a terabyte
Seeking persuasion from desperate minds
Numbers and figures replacing reality
Conquering patrons with dexterous lines

[Verse 2: Jon Mess, Tilian]
That's my body, it's a device
Turn on the anti-rape mechanism
Porcelain shooters, walk past the moon
Macroscopic view
Piece together, shards into cables
Swollen shoulder, rotator cuff
Clandestine, makeshift vestibule
Pardon the unstable broken stuff
All these imposters are making me addicted
Conformist reason is all I can trust

[Verse 3: Tilian, Jon Mess]
(No matter how hard I lie they believe it all)
I did college, majored in smart
Concocted ways to be useless and poor
Successful could barely describe the shape of
My infinite wisdom I can spit from mouth
(No matter how hard I lie they believe it all)
The esoteric righteous believer
Repeat the process, becoming a monk
The morality, was it derived from or intrinsically inherent?

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
Cold blocks pop, concocts an instant freeze
I'm consistently drawn to the smell of please
Flooded brain tips, I'm seeing shapes like trees
Turn it on its side and rape the vertices
Ripple lifter christening his new bought bricks
Grip my magic, force the page to slip
Rope burn mistress in the cage with a limp
Turn it on its side and smack the weak out the wimp
For slump

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Put it in my fist and squish 'n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Put it in my fist and squish 'n twist with the wrist
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my
Hotter than my, hotter than my

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Get it away from me, get it away from me
Empty it out, empty it out
Get it away from me, get it away from me
Empty it out, empty it out

[Intro: Tilian]
Hush now, don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
You won't realize it's over
'Til you slip into unconsciousness and the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers and embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over

I take a bow, listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best, we'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now

[Chorus 2: Tillian]
Hush now, don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
His self-repairing skeleton
Cyborg man's computer blood
Programming immunity
Alpha being
His knowledge expands exponentially
As he rapidly evolves ad infinitum

Deleting disease, cut and sever
Cells and metal blend together
Replicating, assimilating, science and biology
The death of the robot, the birth of him
All at once we'll become him
The death of the robot, the birth of him
One by one we'll become him

[Bridge: Will Swan]
Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy
Level up his brain, in the fast lane
Make this being holy
Put him through the test inspections
Make this motherfucker holy
Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
In future utopias, alpha hybrids evolve
Into progressive societies, worship efficiency
Technology makes me pray to logic and science makes us strong
We rape the ignorance of man, prepare the arrival
Right on time he arrives
Alleviate the symptoms from a toxic society
We praise the future

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
You won't realize it's over
'Til you slip into unconsciousness and the moment takes over
Swallow your pride my soldiers and embrace your abilities
Let your new mind take over

I take a bow, listen to the crowd
My survival is all I think about now
It's for the best, we'll cure the helpless
Our survival is all we'll think about now

[Chorus 2: Tillian]
Hush now, don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
Hush now, don't you cry
Everything will be just fine
Hush now, don't you cry
Hush now, don't you cry
Everything will be just fine

[Outro: Will Swan]
Put him through the test inspections
Make this motherfucker holy
Make this motherfucker golden
Make this motherfucker holy

[Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian]
I'm sick of twisting the knobs, your little baby's a slob
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I think I panic a lot, not really sure what I've got
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I'm sick of twisting the knobs (So where is my sweet love?)
I think I've hidden from myself, but there's too many layers
I turn my head and cough, like I'm calling the cops
Is there something more to you than just bible study?

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Turn your camera on
You don't wanna miss this
The way the lighting shifts as it reflects off the water
Below the sinking ship I feel your fingertips slipping away
Can't shake the feeling now, how far we've fallen down
Like our best days are behind us
You're the revisionist and I'm the narcissist drifting away

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
To my sunstroke, ghost dance, gold corona
Did I crack that lens, put my weight upon ya?
Does the manifest dictate to love and honor?
Can the creed uphold, can we repeat our mantra?
Trust my luck and show my feelings
Cross my fingers, cards are dealing
Busting out my skull shaped ceiling
Hold my fucking body back
I'm still raging from the sanction you placed upon the impoverished nations
Delusions of grandeur, have some patience
Hold my fucking body back

[Verse 3: Tilian]
I can't predict the future and I can't forget the past
Can't focus any longer, desperate to make this last
Keep us from going under, won't waste all that we have
You called it in November and it burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash
Burned up in a flash

[Verse 4: Tilian]
Feel the hangover in my mind
But this one's a different kind
Losing touch with my concept of time
My senses are frozen
Losing touch with my concept of time
My senses are frozen

[Chorus: Jon Mess, Tilian]
I'm sick of twisting the knobs, your little baby's a slob
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I think I panic a lot, not really sure what I've got
I wanna love you but this house ain't built for two
I'm sick of twisting the knobs (So where is my sweet love?)
I think I've hidden from myself, but there's too many layers
I turn my head and cough, like I'm calling the cops
Is there something more to you than just bible study?

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world, but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam, wearing sacrificial clothes

[Verse 1: Tilian Pearson]
I haven't slept for weeks
Just a couple more and I'll be yours
I'll be coming home again
And we'll tear apart those sheets
And forget the world a little while
Get to know your form again

[Verse 2: Jon Mess, Tilian]
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to hear what you're seeing
Say the part, say the phrase, say the meaning
I want to know what you're feeling
If it's making sense on time, then why do I hear their whines?
If it moves and breathes it's fine, don't let it mess with your mind
Do you feel alone when I'm not home?
Touch as you please, you should feel free
Paging Dr. Mess, your patient's throwing food and ate his robe

[Chorus: Tilian]
You always keep me coming back for more
So many faces in the world, but I want yours
The way you make me feel inside my bones
I can't remember how it feels to be alone
And when you call my phone late at night
Anticipation always burns me up inside

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Shimmy my way down underground, polluting airways in my wake
Swaying architecture, grappling a birthday cake
It's analogy backfire in the cliché storm of backwards prose
Shoot the agony beam, wearing sacrificial clothes

[Verse 3: Jon Mess, Tilian]
Quantum something can do anything (Easier said than done)
An accidental public confession made (Can't be the only one)
I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright
(That jacket looks good on most people)
Confused cause I'm too dumb to find the light
(Finally exiled)

[Bridge: Tilian]
Overcome by circumstance
I put my life in the devil's hands
Fell lower than before, lower than ever before
I know it's hard to forgive me now
But I swear I've taught myself how to barricade the door
I won't go there anymore
Overcome by circumstance, separated by consequence
I fell lower than before, lower than I have before
If I could just get through to you
We could put in the final screws to the barricade the door
And start back where we were

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Carcinogenic isotope, we need the A-team montage
Disregard the message from the ending of the album

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian]
How, how could we forget about you?
The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood
Of all the iterations, yeah, you're the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you?
Say you don't hate me for nothing
Hate me for falling out of reach
Hate me for something
Never knew that you could be so lonely, lonely
Falling out of feelings, so pretend you can be lonely, lonely
Stuck in your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Can't let it go
What hurts you the most
Is I wasn't there to beg you
"Baby, don't go"
Put on a show

[Chorus: Tilian]
Light it up, light it up
No, it's not a phase
It's the way that she combs my hair
Never wake, never wake from this coma

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
How, how could we forget about you?
The summoner, the centerfold, successor to the brood
Of all the iterations, yeah, you're the sickest dude
Fighting cow, how could we forget about you?
Light it up for us, show me the way you're growing
Your catharsis is beautiful, I wish I could be you
Show up at the ball wit yo doo-doo faced babe
The robot with human hair is dead, but gets laid
That's why he's got all these kids on the way
His son's a girl named baby swirl that loves to swang his blade

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Can't let it go
What hurts you the most
Is I wasn't there to beg you
"Baby, don't go"
Put on a show

[Chorus: Tilian]
Light it up, light it up
No, it's not a phase
It's the way that she combs my hair
Never wake, never wake from this coma

[Outro: Tilian]
Light it up for us, show me the way you're growing
Your catharsis is beautiful, brighter
How I wish I could touch you
Feel you, breathe you, be just like you

[Intro: Tilian]
Used to be so judgmental
Now I respect the ones
Who dare to be sinful
I was searching for my pride
Now I know it's all fleeting
Just glad to be alive

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Brontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making
Good mistakes and branching out, he switch it up like baking
The more I tried to sleep it off, the more I started thinking
I wanna live in Mushroom Park, do unrestricted shrinking

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
You're salty, can't fault you
I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
Take all your confetti away

[Chorus: Tilian]
I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love or sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Made up magic turtle guy is feeling like he's crap
He needs to spend some time alone to understand his path
There's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to
It takes in information and it sorts it out for you

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Won't fight you, not like you
But I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you
I'll take your confetti away

[Chorus: Tilian]
I know, I know what's killing me
Don't need your love or sympathy
I know, I know just what you'll say
Don't you try to rescue me

[Post-Chorus: Tilian]
Don't you try to rescue me
Don't you try to rescue me

[Bridge: Tilian]
Now you're on a midnight crusade
Flexing your stats
But you can't touch me, touch me, touch me
Tell me how to think my own way
You can give it your best
But you won't touch me, touch me, touch me

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I'm kissing a baby, then licking a boot
I live in a deli, put meat on your tooth
My business is pregnant and flaunting off nude
I'm smoking a chicken I took out the coupe
Show off addictions and make it sound fiction
You aren't doing art if you're dead in the park
If you feel like you died, show 'em you have
Give up your life for the virtual clap
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you're a spiritless fearless lil lyricist
Shear off the weird and then watch 'em appear
Now you're a spiritless, fearless lil lyricist
Hoax

[Intro: Jon Mess]
There is no operation
Doctor Mess goes flagrant
Till he makes you leggo yo eggo
They scheming, bottom-feeding
Robbing them cribs
Don't let those veterinarians
Close to your kids

[Refrain: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did this dude just did this?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags

[Verse 1: Tilian]
You got me begging for an answer
Indecision's cancer
Waiting at your beck and call
I don't know how long I can take it
Trying to read your body language
Only got you moving back and forth

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce

[Chorus: Tilian]
How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster
Canceled my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Over and over
Over and over you're complicated
Over and over I'm fascinated
Frustrated

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce

[Chorus: Tilian]
How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster
Canceled my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did this dude just did this?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags

[Verse 1: Tilian]
For now, we'll lay by the ocean
For now, no one is around
For now, we'll act like we're still young
For now, we'll never come down

[Refrain: Tilian]
I know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
You still care (I remember you back in the day)
Care (Prodigy show 2003)
Care (We were camping out in Jnco jeans)
Care (The ecstasy was super clean)

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Higher than all of their voices
Higher than fading away
Got lost, lost in the moment
Got lost in tempting our fate

[Refrain: Tilian]
I know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
You still care (I remember you back in the day)
Care (Prodigy show 2003)
Care (We were camping out in Jnco jeans)
Care (The ecstasy was super clean)

[Bridge: Tilian; both]
And you can rub it in my face
Sabotage all my connections
The parasites won't go away
They live inside you
Got nothing clean for you to taint
Already gave you a confession
Propagating every consequence
'Til hate consumes you

[Refrain: Tilian]
I know you're not empty
I know you're still there
I know you're not empty
I know you still care

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I never wanted to be singing about you again
But you keep locked, in your possession, half of my soul
Goddamn, you caught me looking back
Goddamn, with no discretion
Goddamn, you got me going mad
Goddamn, it's an obsession
I never wanted to be caught up in not looking back
I never wanted to be treated like a psycho
I never wanted to be singing about you again
I couldn't face another second of your vacant threats
I couldn't shuffle through the pieces of my costume
I never wanted to be singing about you again
Goddamn, you caught me looking back
Goddamn, with no discretion
Goddamn, you got me going mad
Goddamn, it's an obsession

[Intro: Tilian]
So you don't believe in magic
I'm never falling from these habits
No, who's ever really static
Just take my honor, you can have it

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain't nothing you can do to change it
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life's not fair
Empathy is overrated

[Chorus: Tilian]
Look the other way, always been my game
Got a way of cleaning all the shame tryna stain my name
Look the other way, darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling like I'm faking every single breath I take

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain't nothing you can do to change it
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life's not fair
Empathy is overrated

[Chorus: Tilian]
Look the other way, always been my game
Got a way of cleaning all the shame tryna stain my name
Look the other way, darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling like I'm faking every single breath I take

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Look the other way, always been my game
Got away pretending like I'm faking every single word I say

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Come up in my closet, I'ma get you fat
That's a chill initial feeling when I come right back
I can see the orchids blooming out your beautiful crack
Since my head is now my belly, I need big brain snacks
Welcome to my odd ass city with the lopsided loaves
The limp wristed winded sex on abdomen
What's my style? I'm blind to dude tooth clang
Chomp real loud, I tuned out all intervals
Looking through the glass watching eyes cry glitter
Slid in on a sack laced in body suit slipper
I'ma peel in two and then shed my image
Turn into some panoramic spinning gold bridges
Cah Shwink

[Intro: Jon Mess]
I got a sudden itch, they're gonna raise my rent
I'm gonna run around, let people know I don't need this
I want to, I'd like to, I'm gonna file, yeah
March around, through the town
It's all going down, wow

[Chorus: Tilian]
Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that
Been a little while since we played as kids
I found it impressive, the way you worked those wooden limbs
But she's amazing for every occasion
I want a lot more of your mom around
I'm sad she's gone and couldn't have more time
To notice all the ways her bright ass shines
But he's impatient, creeps on Brayden
No one really likes your dad around

[Chorus: Tilian]
Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love

[Bridge: Tilian]
I'm at the top of my little world
But I never felt so alone
The more it seems like I've grown the more
I've been shrinking in
I drown myself in material
Waiting for some kind of punishment
But consequence don't make no sense
When there's nobody there who gives a damn

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I don't know you very well
But they don't have to know that
We don't have to show that
Now that winter's over and you got an apartment
I think about the times when we shaved our armpits
And she was gracious, knew we were wasted
I wish we had more of your mom around
The big city life is getting busy and hectic
We should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus
And he was racist, except for Asians
And no one really likes your dad around

[Chorus: Tilian]
Stay, wait
Doesn't matter what they say, fake
Doesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix
We can taste what it's like to love
Stay, wait
Does it matter if I pay? Fake
Doesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything
I can vaguely relate to love

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Eye-yai-yai-ya-yai
I'm stuffed
Eye-yai-yai-ya-yai
Nice pup
Eye-yai, Eye-yai
Eye-yai, Eye-yai
Eye-yai-yai-yai
I'll never replay, yuh

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals, hear the seal 'bout to break
Wore out my wheels while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeals, hear the seal 'bout to break
Retired is a word that I hate
I go quiet 'cause I know how to think
Skunk pliers are the tools of the dank
Young friar is my new chicken drank

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Why you try and go and touch people?
Eight hundred sixty seven bald eagles
Why you try and go and touch people?
Eight hundred sixty seven red beetles

[Chorus: Tilian]
Where do you wanna be?
Have you settled for the comfort of security?

[Refrain: Tilian]
Half-baked, what a waste
Out of shape but not overweight
If you show restraint, you can separate

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Die, die, die, die, die, ya bad apples
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Use your face like a dumbass rattle
My accent my glibness, a bee dipped in brass
I'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past
A passionate servant when I'm paid in cash
Don't ask if it's worth it, don't think 'bout the math
There's no complaining in the mansion, you can't do just what I do
I chuck my brain through the black, climb up the tree
Shoot out the cannon, fuck her 'cause she reads
Punctuation violation perpetrator is verified
Hi, hi, hi, hi

[Refrain: Tilian]
Wanted you to know
I came close to being another echo
Don't have a soul, but I'm on a roll
Comfort in the words of a swindler
Everybody needs approval
One love in the holes of a savior

[Bridge: Tilian]
Act like you're above them
All the lives you're running
Will you ever feel it again?
Like you're part of something
Worth fighting for (Worth fighting for)
Worth dying for (Dying for)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Flunked out and flung from the front of your face, wait
I smell Sharon's pimple, it's the size of grapes
I'm so splintered that my mind waved back
I had cash, but sold it for some soul, I'm da wraith

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
My mistake
Thought this year would bring something different
And I'm the same old story, haunted memories
All the way (All the way)
All the way from the warmth of your hands
You wouldn't even let me hold them
Another one (Another one), so over them
Kill me twice, finalize my shelf life
Now you're alone, do you feel any better?
Left to commence, in a heavy head

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
The brightest of wizards (Leave me)
I bit her and love came on gushing out (Leave me)
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale, felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious (Leave me)
Account getting roasted and flayed (Leave me)
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away

[Bridge: Kurt Travis & Tilian]
Please don't feel like I'm attacking you
I did some things too and pushed you away
It needs to, the feelings of the past will surely fade through
To live another day
Looked like I was someone I could barely recognize
Hope it's not too late to scatter this disguise

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
My mistake
Thought this year would bring something different
And I'm the same old story, haunted memories
All the way (All the way)
All the way from the warmth of your hands
You wouldn't even let me hold them

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
The brightest of wizards (Leave me)
I bit her and love came on gushing out (Leave me)
Guzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale, felt it wrap around
Payments get vicious (Leave me)
Account getting roasted and flayed (Leave me)
I started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian]
What a feeling when I'm feeling the feel for real
I'm over woke and flipping a table
I shed a tear and then appear in the mirror
Still here, but blasted out through pineal cable
Sand trap, the only path is still under construction
Same vein, but different textures
An infinite selection

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the braid
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip back the attraction

[Chorus: Tilian]
I hide away, pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching
I lie awake when all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Come back to my range
If you can't hang you know I won't change
She'd be a model if you gave her some time
She'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign
I can see it and it's audibly wobbly
Tastes just like a can of broccoli
Fishin' hook like slimy apostrophe
One letter missing 'tween two monstrosities

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'm finna whip my hip out my frame
Twist bone that hooks through the brain
Loops lonely needs a twin action
Fast enough to flip the attraction

[Chorus: Tilian]
I hide away, pacing back and forth
Some vanity is what I need
But I'm stuck slouching
I lie awake when all my dreams fall short
Of everything that I could be
If I stopped slouching

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
(Oh, blast)
Cut after cut of liquid energy
Beams are buffed and I'm like "yay"
Back in the beast, hate this impulse slave
Close it up and then ride the wave
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
Snake round the wheel, now I know what I've known
I just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow
All wrapped up and raving, and rolled through the snow, go

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 1: Tilian]
My friends and I have parted ways
You know I love to make mistakes
I'm a disaster, no one's laughing

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control

[Verse 2: Tilian]
I got nobody left to blame
No hopeful trust for me to break
Been dying faster, no one's laughing

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Be my bruiser, trust me I'm a loser
You're a classy lady, how'd you get so bad?
I'm unruly, tie me up and school me
You've got privilege, baby, how'd you get so sad?
And you can love me, hate me
Just don't try to save me
Call my name and drag it through the mud
Love me, hate me
Go on try to break me
Go on try to break me
I see the glass half poured
And then I pee inside the pitcher
I wanna wet the bed
'Cause it reminds me I'm a swimmer
And when I feel like Greg
Then I remind me that I'm Jon (Hi, Jon!)
I like to make a mess
And then shit on every song

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
Don't act like you know me
I'm smoking weed out of a pussy filled with money, I like this
It's under control
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I jump off a cliff, I like this
We're at the end of the mission, no need for decisions
I fall in a ditch, I like this

[Intro: Jon Mess]
You don't need a baby, you need to go crazy
You need to meet God
Put it in a painting, a picture of it raining
A symbol of us
Double, double dare, you pissed off your parents
Now your car
Gonna take care, it's yours, not our hair
And so we have fun

[Verse 1: Tilian]
These voices attacking my head
Distracting me from what I knew I should have said
But I got a shred of dedication
Maybe some desperation
We're all having fun

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up
Hair song, it's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun

[Post-Chorus: Tilian]
Blow it up, blow it out now
Blow it up, blow it out

[Bridge: Tilian]
Forget what they say about me
I'm in here where they can't touch me
Right now ain't no one above me
All my faithful children love me
Where I leave my woes behind
Where I go to burn my time
It's the brightest I can shine
In this world I breathe divine

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
You don't need a baby, you need to go crazy
You need to meet God
Put it in a painting, a picture of it raining
A symbol of us
Double, double dare, you pissed off your parents
Now your car
Gonna take care, it's yours, not our hair
So we have fun

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Hack, slash, braid and cut
Twist, curl and tease the tuft
Blow it out and spray the stuff
Slick it back and fluff it up
Hair song, it's a great one to get ready to
Have your friend do your make up fool
Catch up with a dear loved one
You can make it hard or you can make it fun

[Verse 1: Tilian]
They say, "Don't ever meet your heroes"
Reverence is temporary until the truth comes out
Do yourself a favor, die young, ignorance is celebrated
Don't let dark sides come out

[Chorus: Tilian]
Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth, don't run it
Shut that shit down

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility?
It ain't permanent vacations
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down)
Yeah, you think you give a great hug
(Shut that shit down, down, down, down)
No, yeah, you think you give a great hug
(Down, down, down)
No, yeah, you squish your little face smug
(Shut that shit down, down, down, down)
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Tilian]
Feeling
Lately, I've been feeling like all my friends I used to love
Have turned out to be sociopaths
Do they even know what it's like in the real world?
Too busy getting high
Now their vacancies are a reminder of
All the ways I used to sell myself
Lack of compassion down for the cause
Feeding the fever whatever the cost

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Wanna deify opinion
Evidence is secondary
East-west equals North-south
Do yourself a favor, die young
Ignorance is advocated
Don't let gospel burn out

[Chorus: Tilian]
Keep your eyes closed
If you're ever gonna stand for something
Keep your head down, closed
If you want to keep your mouth, don't run it
Shut that shit down

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
If you need some company
You should meet these obligations
What's responsibility?
It ain't permanent vacations
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down)
Yeah, you think you give a great hug
(Shut that shit down, down, down, down)
No, yeah, you think you give a great hug
(Down, down, down)
No, yeah, you squish your little face smug
(Shut that shit down, down, down, down)
Oh, yeah you got your validation, huh?
(Down, down, down)
Yeah, be your own patient
(Shut that shit down, down, down, down)
Oh, Yeah you got your validation, huh?
(Down, down, down)
Yeah, you squish your little face smug
(Shut that shit down, down, down)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro: Tilian]
Feeling, feeling

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I'm not looking down and then looking away
I'mma cook a brat like I cook a filet
Nobody out here has been talking to Dave
Will ain't even liking what you had to say
Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
That's your own mother
Bloodsucker

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Somehow, you can breathe somehow
What a waste of paradise, sucking life

[Chorus: Tilian]
You've become predictable, way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role, you flourish in the pain

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I figure that was another ass hard ass part
My coke's inside this bloodied rag
I'm in a stats class, smoking backpack pie chart
With a grove of muddy greaser bees

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Check your ballot and vote this dick, right?
You gotta eat, right?
You gotta eat, right?
Do you even love her?
Do you even love her?
That's your own mother
Bloodsucker

[Chorus: Tilian; both]
You've become predictable, way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role, you flourish in the pain
Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role, you flourish in the pain

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I will watch you suffer like a good consumer should
Popcorn in my belly tells me you're misunderstood
Wait, I feel nothing
Am I becoming desensitized to virtue touting?
Judgments, they're scowling
Pigeons, they're howling
Nobody stops to listen
You gotta be on alcohol to hang out in a shopping mall
There's nothing left to buy that isn't cheaper online
The only reason I'm alive is waiting for the A.I
To do some tight shit and lemme suck its fucking dick
She like it puffy and comfy and lumpy
Go make your ass a frumpy dumpy, bro

[Chorus: Tilian; both]
You've become predictable, way you play is typical
Settled in the victim's role, you flourish in the pain
Face facts, you'd love to be attacked
The retroactive pieces fit to match all your embellishments
Settled in the victim's role, you flourish in the pain
Can't take it back, accusations, fact
Denial becomes evidence to crucify the innocent
Settled in the victim's role, he'll anguish in the pain

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Squawk, seven-five
Zero, zero mane
World in a barrel dripping some blood
Three dead riders
Gripping the reigns of saturn
In the last plastic cup

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Couldn't make me into a hero
Couldn't turn me into a coward
Whatever history that you wrote
Blew away in the wind on your way down
From your ivory tower
Your words lost their power
You can aim down fire
We'll be down here living how we want

[Refrain: Jon Mess & Andrew Wells]
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
You always see right through me
When I am lost and out of place
You always watch me stumble down
While you wait for me to drown

[Verse 2: Andrew Wells]
Of all the ways I've given in
I can't believe it's not enough
To satisfy my endless search for any form of love
So I will stay my course until you break my wrists
Do everything you can to keep me silent
You wanna start a war with all that I stand for

[Chorus: Tilian]
You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide, I'm cellophane

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I feel like I'm gonna stay
I feel like I'm gonna change
I feel like I'm gonna stay

[Refrain: Jon Mess & Andrew Wells]
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
Never coming back, never coming back
Run into a smack with a hand to deliver
You always see right through me
When I am lost and out of place
You always watch me stumble down
While you wait for me to drown

[Chorus: Tilian]
You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide, I'm cellophane
All of the handsome fiction will melt away
And when the flame burns brighter, evaporate
You always see right through my, my masquerade
I know there's nowhere to hide, I'm cellophane
All of the fabrications will melt away
And when the flame burns hotter, evaporate

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Oh, you should have listened to your friends
(I believe there's meaning)
You would have been over this by now
(No, I believe there's nothing)
(I believe there's meaning)
(No, I believe there's nothing)
Over this by now
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
I'm found
(Who drains the blood from my head? I do, I do)
(Who accepts me as I am? I do, I do)

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian; both]
(Repeat, repeat)
What excuses do you make?
(Repeat, repeat)
We own the night
(Repeat, repeat our history)
For one good note
Well, don't it feel good?
You got what you paid for
Well, don't it feel good?
You got what you paid for

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian; both]
Gimme that canvas, let me paint some shit
Pass me some poison, let me take a hit
I'm just embarrassed and comfortably numb
But failure is painful and lying is fun
Dress code, cocktails, looking so fancy
We feel like we're a little bit classy
Cheers to the fact that we're not dead
Swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet
Psycho I go right to buy those
Optimistic magic fix it pills
I'm so right though, that's my life, bro
Underwater, coughing with my gills

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Don't let this moment go to waste
You don't know when the feeling could happen again
Don't let this moment go to waste
You don't know when the feeling could happen again

[Chorus: Tilian]
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
'Cause lately, baby, I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
'Cause lately, baby, I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'll go in cryo and return to life, ho
And make a bisque, tomato basil shit
Riding a rhino, pico de gallo
Roosters beak, I'll sleep when I leap that jeep

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian; both]
Gimme that canvas, let me paint some shit
Pass me some poison, let me take a hit
I'm just embarrassed and comfortably numb
But failure is painful and lying is fun
Dress code, cocktails, looking so fancy
We feel like we're a little bit classy
Cheers to the fact that we're not dead
Swimming with the sharks, but we're still not dead yet

[Chorus: Tilian]
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
'Cause lately, baby, I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment
Touch me, taste me, tell me I'm not fading
Tell me that I look just like a man
'Cause lately, baby, I've been going crazy
Trying not to be an embarrassment

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'll go in cryo and return to life, ho
And make a bisque, tomato basil shit
Riding a rhino, pico de gallo
Roosters beak, I'll sleep when I leap that jeep

[Bridge: Tilian]
Don't close your eyes tonight
Perfect melodies are hard to find (I got a feeling)
I got a feeling we can touch the sky
Let's live in this delusion
That we don't live in perpetual confusion
And there's meaning to our lives

[Outro: Jon Mess; both]
Hades arc, golden tarp, black hole
Slack is for- slack is for cutting me more
Mountain, fountain, shrieking, preaching
Slack is for- slack is for cutting me
Slack is for cutting me more
For every little bit of sunshine, I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun
For every little bit of sunshine, I call freedom
White 21 is the maximum fun

[Intro: Tilian]
This time, won't blame myself
It's been long time coming, been a long time coming
This time I know you well
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming
Follow me, they're gonna follow
'Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't worry, no
You don't have to bear your soul about it, no
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way
Go away, you can't stay
You got no more reasons left to come my way
Brain, robot wang
Gonna slang through the tang
I-8764, the sex assistant
I-8764, it's no commitment

[Chorus: Tilian]
She said "Drink that love, don't demand it
'Cause baby, I can't stand it when you look so pathetic"
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
"Drink that love, it's like a habit"
Feeling like a savage, you know I gotta have it
Ah, I gotta have it all

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
I wish I didn't miss this
Ah-ah, I gotta have it all
They call me hedonistic
Can't stop with the rhythm, gotta have it all
I make them kiss they sistas
Ah-ah, I gotta have it all
He flips his black ass robot hair

[Chorus: Tilian]
She said "Drink that love, don't demand it
'Cause baby, I can't stand it when you look so pathetic"
But I can't stop with the rhythm of it
"Drink that love, it's like a habit"
Feeling like a savage, you know I gotta have it
Ah, I gotta have it all

[Bridge: Tilian]
Ooh-ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
You're on another planet
Ooh-ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
You're on another planet

[Outro: Tilian]
Follow me, they're gonna follow
'Cause I'm on the inside and they're on the outside waiting
This time I know myself
It's been a long time coming, been a long time coming

[Verse 1: Jon Mess, Tilian]
It never was compatible, but something made it flammable
We were young and so jealous and we let it all go to waste
Don't bother having a conscience, now stuff our life into bags
We were young and so jealous, and we let it all

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Fake the smallest version of myself
Can't shake this moment inside of my head

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Duck in shame and sink into my shell
And play it over and over again until the favors end
Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
Feeling like you're fading, complaining and wasting away

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I slip the sloppy g'day, the drink is always amazed
At how much I would like to let it control me
I make a pact with my friends, we'll never lose a game again
Unless the shots I take are served from the bar

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
I'm about to toast
You're telling me I'm the chosen one
(But I'm stuck inside a funk)
But lately I've been the frozen one
(I'm scared of getting punked)
You're telling me I'm the chosen one
(So I'll become a drunk)
But lately I've been the frozen one

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stop that, you ain't no friend of mine
We don't believe your lies
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door
Stop, no need to apologize
No way to make it right
Go on and live your life
Running out the back door

[Verse 3: Jon Mess & Tilian]
It never was compatible but something made it flammable
We were young and so jealous, and we let it all go to waste
Don't bother having a conscience, now stuff our life into bags
We were young and so jealous, and we let it all

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Fake the smallest version of myself
Can't shake this moment inside of my head

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Duck in shame and sink into my shell
And play it over and over again until the favors end
Sit around and waiting, thinking how you're treated
Feeling like you're fading, complaining and wasting away

[Intro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Cocaine
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Ooh, wow
You're looking dirty, need a champagne shower now
Lay down, let's see if we can get the lipstick to come out

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just the- just the song to play
Free your mind from, from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute
Cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care, I'm in it
Cracked out, snap out of it
Mo blow, wow

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest
Cocaine cringe fest

[Verse 2: Tilian]
We tried, no luck, it's all right
Trust me, honey, you look fine
I'll just walk around the city telling chickens that I'm pretty
And I'd love for them to meet my wife

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
I know just the thing, the thing to say
I got just the- just the song to play
Free your mind from, from the cage
I can talk a mile a minute
Cracked out, snap out of it
I don't care, I'm in it
Cracked out, snap out of it
Mo blow (Wow)

[Bridge: Tilian]
And if we move too slow
Let it rot, decay, and decompose
If we just let it flow, the fairy dust could tap out
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
Never been tied down in one place too long
King of the lonely road, it's all I've ever known

[Outro: Tilian]
Make your move tonight (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
C-c-c-close your eyes, don't fight it anymore
And when the sun comes up, we won't be wondering what
Could have been, should have been
Ma-ma-ma-make your move tonight
Make your move tonight

[Intro: Tilian]
Better wake up before it's all gone
Better wake up before it's all gone

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian; both]
Half-wrapped in a leopard print sex swing
The beat is shit and I'm 'bout to make a new slang
If your momma was a bed of kites, then we could fly away
And fuck this night right, I feel the brick wall hit
You've never been me before
I feel the will I trick
Self-deprecation to settle the score
Here comes the reaper to erase what I've become
I won't be plastic, and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic, and neutered and numb
I won't be plastic, and neutered and numb

[Chorus: Tilian]
I couldn't help it, made me wonder
If you're the weight that pulled us under
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
And now I'm pulling back the covers
Thought I could trust you like no other
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
Deception

[Bridge: Tilian]
Cordial graces, smiling faces, back and forth
Antiquated, overrated social whores
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
And there's a code for people like you
Always keeping score
And you will never make me like you
Because I'm colder than before
You made me this way
You made me this way

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Pay your debt, don't suffocate
If you're baking it, don't eat the cake (Code for)
If you're faking it, then show 'em bait
Don't be so disgusting
Like wind on the wick
I see the symptoms inside of your binges (I'm colder)
I checked that you were dead
I check then I got sucked in

[Chorus: Tilian]
I couldn't help it, made me wonder
If you're the weight that pulled us under
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
And now I'm pulling back the covers
Thought I could trust you like no other
All of it was make believe, all of it was make believe
Deception

[Intro: Tilian]
Say you want to know the truth
Well, you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may wanna hear
But I'll lie, lie

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit, bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make-believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self-help perfection hype

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
We can make this real, already tried to go for the gold
Let's go for the stories that remain untold
Aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see
The parable is terrible, but I don't give a sheet
A penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet
The stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Say you wanna know the truth
Well, you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may wanna hear (Wanna hear)
But I'll lie
And I will never let this go, so open wide
'Cause I know you'll always know when you lie, lie

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit, bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I can hear a smacking from the corner of the world
A flap, then another flap that their bird has shat a pearl
Oil commerce tipped the scale and soaked up all the dung
And flung it back for us to catch and eat out of their bums

[Bridge: Tilian]
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick, like "Preacher, preacher"
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick, like "Preacher, preach to me
Tell me what you see
Tell me what I need to do and who to be" (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
So let's start a religion
They'll believe in what we say
Let's start a religion
We can blind their eyes with faith
A new religion
We'll tell them where our spirits go
Start a religion
I need my ego to explode
A new religion (So impressionable)
We can make some widows cry (Attend the festival)
Start a religion (So impressionable)
Can even plan our own demise (Attend the festival)
So let's start a religion (You thought that it mattered?)
(You thought they were flattered?)
We can save some souls tonight (I'm convinced you're an actor)
(You can take off the wrapper)
Let's start a religion (Yeah, I'll whip up the batter)
(But there's nothing you can bake)
Without me, their souls will die
(If your face ain't light, them crackers act fake tonight)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Dry crossing up the holy five hate
Your cousin is my hobby, free throw
I'd toss my calling card, but I'd hate to make a baby feel slow
Nope, bro, there's lots of answers to shit
Like the numbing that you feel is real, then pain grows
You'll get for what you asked
Patience is the lane I mate with, case closed

[Refrain: Tilian]
If I fall, will you be there
To catch me now, catch me now?
Or if I fall, will you be there
To show me how, show me how
I've fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen?

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
All cranky in a blanket with a lazy eye
Same pigeon that was shitting on the other guy
Why yo fitness need a witness?
I too can cook a bunch of little meals
(Friend, friend, make my life)
(Friend, friend, make my life)
I picked 'em up and clipped their hype
It was the tamest type, the little bitch couldn't listen
I flipped it up and twisted night into a padded white room
Bitch named "Kristen"

[Chorus: Tilian]
I will run laps around you, around you
Go on, try, tug me back to you, but I'll fly
Guess they were right
No way to drag your body and make up the time
So I'll focus on mine, not gonna hold me down
I'm leaving you behind

[Bridge: Tilian]
Won't say that you're better
Won't sell you a better lie
Won't tell you etcetera
Won't say that you're doing fine
If your life never turns around
If you should die tomorrow or the week after next
I know that I will be safe and sound (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I won't be there cleaning up all the mess

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
All cranky in a blanket with a lazy eye
Same pigeon that was shitting on the other guy
Why yo fitness need a witness?
I too can cook a bunch of little meals
I felt my body craving
The oxygen from ancient wasteland aching
I wanna be the man with the bacon
Make a light reveal the only stake in fakeness, fucked

[Chorus: Tilian]
I will run laps around you, around you
Go on, try, tug me back to you, but I'll fly
Guess they were right
No way to drag your body and make up the time
So I'll focus on mine, not gonna hold me down
I'm leaving you behind

[Intro: Tilian]
Line them up on a stage
See which ones are clever and which ones declined with age
Watch them fail by design
Or win the hearts of America with manufactured shine

[Refrain: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Here comes the winner (That's my public figure)
Here comes the winner (Taking perfect pictures)
Here comes the winner (It's time to shock the blaow!)
Here comes the winner

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess; both]
You can find me up on my high horse
Cutting the bold ones down
They look so hungry, but I'm well-fed, well-dressed
Dead in the head
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
We don't tolerate whining
Do a bitta good analysis, let's balance this, not backing out
Put a little bitta time in this, a finalist and not in doubt
I shake my scepter fresh and you smell like sphincter
I'll pass my credit check and run through your sprinklers

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
You name the time and the place and I'm there
Give me some time and I'll perfect my hair
Roll the cameras, honey, love's in the air
We look so poised and not too self aware

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement
I grow tired of this game, make me feel like I'm to blame
Fake cry, don't be that guy
The one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Moments together, sell them well
(I just watched you do that all to you)
Oh, moments together
(Find another person you can use)
Moments together, sell them well
(You're not that clever, easy to see through)
Tear the best of us apart

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Don't take offers then act like you think you're gonna lose
Make things awkward to see you faking gratitude
Instructed to go auto-pilot, don't know the password
You're sitting on a dildo pile, that's why your ass hurts

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
So tell me that I am the love of your life
I'll be in character batting my eyes
We'll show them all the supreme prototype
As ratings and followers peak right on time

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement
I grow tired of this game, make me feel like I'm to blame
Fake cry, don't be that guy
The one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Moments together, sell them well
(I just watched you do that all to you)
Oh, moments together
(Find another person you can use)
Moments together, sell them well
(You're not that clever, easy to see through)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tear the best of us apart

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
So high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Intro]
As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go, my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

[Verse 1]
Through all the mud and shit and parasitic cysts
Through all the fingertips, scrat-scratching at my wrists
Through all the devils in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes

[Refrain]
As my secrets start to show
My crippled mouth goes cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And now you're running away
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, don't wander
Still my mouth, still my mouth goes cold

[Chorus]
As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go, my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

[Verse 2]
Through all the fear and doubt, two-faced anxiety
Through all the chemicals bouncing inside my brain
Through all my weakness in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes

[Bridge]
We never saw this coming
But I know we'll keep from drowning
What we got ain't close to nothing
I know we got this, know we got this
When all your doubts surround you
I'll keep us both from drowning
Ain't no two-ways about it
I know we got this, know we got this

[Chorus]
As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go, my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

[Outro]
(My mouth goes cold)
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now
Never thought this would hit me so hard
Staring at my hollow phone, not sure if you're coming home
Bed still smells like I'm not all alone again

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I know we fucked it all up this time
We got so high (Couldn't see the bottom)

[Chorus: Tilian]
I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you (To tell you I)
To tell you I still love you

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
My mental image impaired, undid the braids in my hair
I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels
Remove the tricks of the trade, you're just alone on the stage
There's no witness, fly your soul through the windshield
Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now
Never thought I could hurt you so hard
Staring at my hollow phone, wondering if you've found your home
Feel like I deserve to die alone again

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
We really fucked it all up this time
We got so low (Only for a second)

[Chorus: Tilian]
I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you (To tell you I)
To tell you I still love you

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
Take a sip from the drain, the flavor tastes like nothing
Or nothing tastes the same 'cause nothing is never there
I know what I'm talking 'bout, believe the words in my mouth
'Cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(You know that I won't stop, I'm coming back on top)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(Don't call that it's a flop, I got the refs on lock)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(Damaged pride and vulnerable)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(All my fears are open now)
You know that I won't stop

[Intro: Jon Mess]
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Black cat, brown rat, face off versus fruit bat
The greatest fight we've seen yet, immaculate tact
Green clam, yellow lamb, fight purple face ram
Bets are in, it's not a scam, find out who wins
It's just an animal ass whoop show
Puppy dog had an accident, damn it, mammal
Kangaroo cracks its dick in half, the crowd sprayed crimson
Shark dad ate a baby calf, you still like burgers
Clip-clop, clip-clip-clop
Horse comes out and beats your parents up

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Going away, vacation
Going away, vacation
Vacation

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I don't even fucking feel nobody
I keep sucking up the feeling that it's all a waste
And I'm just waiting in a body

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Blue dog, red frog, face off vs. big hog
Balancing on wet logs, swamp bog, thick fog
Gray duck, white beaver, fight golden retriever
One has meat cleaver nick-named "Life Eater"

[Bridge: Tilian]
Get me out, all your self-commendations
Don't face me now, I'd rather be blind to my malformations
Don't tell me I act like a child, I grew up in a basement
Practicing a smile, practicing a smile

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Ride in the hammock with a bleeding fist
My white sides splitting like the ironic
Cucked little critter from the boards
I sniff around on triggering the weeb racists
Both sides are shit, both sides are flipped
Ripped off the jaw of the idealist
Pick from one of any fantasy pipe dreams

[Intro: Tilian]
Young enough to feel it, young enough to feel it
My body's young enough to feel this, hey
Young enough to feel it
My body rolls, my body rolls

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I could see it gleaming from the back of my dinnerware
Your eye cream sprayed all over little bear
You could reconsider definition of childcare
Fourteen shapes and you pick the giant square

[Chorus: Tilian]
Young enough to feel it, young enough to feel it
My body's young enough to feel this, hey
Young enough to feel it
My body rolls, my body rolls

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I couldn't face the fact that my ass ain't a plaque
There's a wall and my behind is not there
I couldn't wait to tap into the brain of my cat
And let him know he's my widdle baby meow-meow-boo

[Bridge: Will Swan, Jon Mess & Tilian]
Up in the casino, ain't no doubt I'm 'bout to let it all go
You used to call me on my cellphone
But now you're petting all my friends for sure
Since 2005, I've been living a lie
I'm not even a man, I'm just a cat in disguise
I was born by surprise in the Egyptian times
Bring me a treat and I'll imprint your face forever
And I, I just want to be in my zone
I just want to be in control, no time for you
And God doesn't have a plan for me
Gonna be who I'm gonna be, no thanks to you

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
I fuck them bright clothes, the white guy guy-code
Burnt all the bridges, it's just a pile of wood
I couldn't wait though, admit I ate those
Book-flavored pavement, endorphin tongues
Shy fiction cloud absorbing pictures
Appearance shining, eclipse a culprit ear intake
A pillaplipton mixed in soap and whipped in dear face cloak
To steep me peefers with needle bop
I think of things that I haven't done
Packer Wilita, Tilly, Billy, block blood

[Outro: Tilian]
Don't let go, I know you want a little more
Don't be gross and I'll be good to you (Ah-ah)
Call my phone, I know you want a little more
Let it flow, I can be good to you
You and I, we can linger under starlit skies
Help me survive

[Intro: Tilian]
Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to hopeful lovers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Don't be alarmed to discover, siren songs can pull you under
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
On the seas of mass temptation, keep your course of moderation
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
And if you prove a lying coward, feel the wrath of higher powers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Fade, writhe, crash, peel
I'm feeling it, the feel of it, the wheel can turn, the wick is lit
I feel like something, before I feel like nothing
Crawling through the clouds that morph into mouths
Agree to be swallowed, ignore being hollowed out
Facilitate the power trip, I like to watch you deal with it
Savor every little bit of knowledge you obtain

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't you hurt me again
Pride, feed me pride, I'm fiending
My mind and my body won't be able to take the pain
(You can never ever diss on this dick)
(You can barely even write this shit)
I'd rather you were dead
More, give it more conejo
Than lying, cheating, draining my patience away
(Feed it pieces, make it sleepy)

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to vicious lovers
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it
Yeah, I deserve to be a servant
When you go, go, go, go
Act so blind to rediscover, siren songs can pull you under
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it
Yeah, I deserve to be a servant
When you go, go, go, go, go

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Say I'm worth it, I'm your person
So well-versed in, I'll immerse in you

[Bridge: Tilian]
Filled with regret, alone in the end
Barely a man, I ran from every decision
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
I don't need a friend I'd rather keep it all to myself now
'Cause it's hard enough to follow up the fees of my self-doubt
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Don't have the time to start over again
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Ran out of time, now it's over again

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Dive through the heart of a demon
(Oh-oh-oh, again)
Shine a light on my kingdom portrait
(Oh-oh-oh, again)
Fly straight over the pieces of you
Suck sludge straight through the straw, I need you (Again)
Fade, fade (Again)
Fade, fade, fade into the grave

[Intro: Tilian]
Say you want to know the truth
Well, you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may wanna hear
But I'll lie, lie

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit, bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make-believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self-help perfection hype

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
We can make this real, already tried to go for the gold
Let's go for the stories that remain untold
Aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see
The parable is terrible, but I don't give a sheet
A penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet
The stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
Say you wanna know the truth
Well, you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may wanna hear (Wanna hear)
But I'll lie
And I will never let this go, so open wide
'Cause I know you'll always know when you lie, lie

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
I don't really wanna be the bitch that gives a shit, bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I can hear a smacking from the corner of the world
A flap, then another flap that their bird has shat a pearl
Oil commerce tipped the scale and soaked up all the dung
And flung it back for us to catch and eat out of their bums

[Bridge: Tilian]
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick, like "Preacher, preacher"
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick, like "Preacher, preach to me
Tell me what you see
Tell me what I need to do and who to be" (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
So let's start a religion
They'll believe in what we say
Let's start a religion
We can blind their eyes with faith
A new religion
We'll tell them where our spirits go
Start a religion
I need my ego to explode
A new religion (So impressionable)
We can make some widows cry (Attend the festival)
Start a religion (So impressionable)
Can even plan our own demise (Attend the festival)
So let's start a religion (You thought that it mattered?)
(You thought they were flattered?)
We can save some souls tonight (I'm convinced you're an actor)
(You can take off the wrapper)
Let's start a religion (Yeah, I'll whip up the batter)
(But there's nothing you can bake)
Without me, their souls will die
(If your face ain't light, them crackers act fake tonight)

[Intro: Tilian]
Line them up on a stage
See which ones are clever and which ones declined with age
Watch them fail by design
Or win the hearts of America with manufactured shine

[Refrain: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Here comes the winner (That's my public figure)
Here comes the winner (Taking perfect pictures)
Here comes the winner (It's time to shock the blaow!)
Here comes the winner

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess; both]
You can find me up on my high horse
Cutting the bold ones down
They look so hungry, but I'm well-fed, well-dressed
Dead in the head
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
It's here, it's right there, for you to take it all
We don't tolerate whining
Do a bitta good analysis, let's balance this, not backing out
Put a little bitta time in this, a finalist and not in doubt
I shake my scepter fresh and you smell like sphincter
I'll pass my credit check and run through your sprinklers

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
You name the time and the place and I'm there
Give me some time and I'll perfect my hair
Roll the cameras, honey, love's in the air
We look so poised and not too self aware

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement
I grow tired of this game, make me feel like I'm to blame
Fake cry, don't be that guy
The one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Moments together, sell them well
(I just watched you do that all to you)
Oh, moments together
(Find another person you can use)
Moments together, sell them well
(You're not that clever, easy to see through)
Tear the best of us apart

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Don't take offers then act like you think you're gonna lose
Make things awkward to see you faking gratitude
Instructed to go auto-pilot, don't know the password
You're sitting on a dildo pile, that's why your ass hurts

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
So tell me that I am the love of your life
I'll be in character batting my eyes
We'll show them all the supreme prototype
As ratings and followers peak right on time

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'll pretend I'm better than these clowns and their plastic faces
On another level, pound for pound and their self-abasement
I grow tired of this game, make me feel like I'm to blame
Fake cry, don't be that guy
The one who tries to victimize himself to hide a web of lies

[Post-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Moments together, sell them well
(I just watched you do that all to you)
Oh, moments together
(Find another person you can use)
Moments together, sell them well
(You're not that clever, easy to see through)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tear the best of us apart

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
So high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
We're so high (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now
Never thought this would hit me so hard
Staring at my hollow phone, not sure if you're coming home
Bed still smells like I'm not all alone again

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I know we fucked it all up this time
We got so high (Couldn't see the bottom)

[Chorus: Tilian]
I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you (To tell you I)
To tell you I still love you

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
My mental image impaired, undid the braids in my hair
I rain destruction in the fight of my inner feels
Remove the tricks of the trade, you're just alone on the stage
There's no witness, fly your soul through the windshield
Damaged pride and vulnerable, all my fears are open now
Never thought I could hurt you so hard
Staring at my hollow phone, wondering if you've found your home
Feel like I deserve to die alone again

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
We really fucked it all up this time
We got so low (Only for a second)

[Chorus: Tilian]
I just crashed my car
And it got me thinking of you
So I just thought I'd call
To tell you (To tell you I)
To tell you I still love you

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
Take a sip from the drain, the flavor tastes like nothing
Or nothing tastes the same 'cause nothing is never there
I know what I'm talking 'bout, believe the words in my mouth
'Cause I can say that it was all just a metaphor

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(You know that I won't stop, I'm coming back on top)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(Don't call that it's a flop, I got the refs on lock)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(Damaged pride and vulnerable)
In my heart and in my own mind in my soul
I know that they ain't never gonna break me
(All my fears are open now)
You know that I won't stop

[Intro: Tilian]
Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to hopeful lovers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Don't be alarmed to discover, siren songs can pull you under
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
On the seas of mass temptation, keep your course of moderation
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
And if you prove a lying coward, feel the wrath of higher powers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Fade, writhe, crash, peel
I'm feeling it, the feel of it, the wheel can turn, the wick is lit
I feel like something, before I feel like nothing
Crawling through the clouds that morph into mouths
Agree to be swallowed, ignore being hollowed out
Facilitate the power trip, I like to watch you deal with it
Savor every little bit of knowledge you obtain

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Don't you hurt me again
Pride, feed me pride, I'm fiending
My mind and my body won't be able to take the pain
(You can never ever diss on this dick)
(You can barely even write this shit)
I'd rather you were dead
More, give it more conejo
Than lying, cheating, draining my patience away
(Feed it pieces, make it sleepy)

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to vicious lovers
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it
Yeah, I deserve to be a servant
When you go, go, go, go
Act so blind to rediscover, siren songs can pull you under
I think you're perfect, I'm worth it
Yeah, I deserve to be a servant
When you go, go, go, go, go

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Say I'm worth it, I'm your person
So well-versed in, I'll immerse in you

[Bridge: Tilian]
Filled with regret, alone in the end
Barely a man, I ran from every decision
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
I don't need a friend I'd rather keep it all to myself now
'Cause it's hard enough to follow up the fees of my self-doubt
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Don't have the time to start over again
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Ran out of time, now it's over again

[Outro: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Dive through the heart of a demon
(Oh-oh-oh, again)
Shine a light on my kingdom portrait
(Oh-oh-oh, again)
Fly straight over the pieces of you
Suck sludge straight through the straw, I need you (Again)
Fade, fade (Again)
Fade, fade, fade into the grave

[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
You'll forget I'm wrong

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison, mitigate my pain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I'm not barely hanging on
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
And medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
Medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
(You're dead, you're dead, you're dead now)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate our aging faces

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
It's so relieving to show my ray
Beam of belief in identity
It's not deceiving to be this way
I came to show you my sack
The things that you do with your attitude
I'm awkward, I'm chipper, I'm random dude
The picture, I like it, so don't be rude
We all came here just to fap

[Chorus: Tilian]
I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Take my money take all that I've got
All that I've got

[Verse 2: Jon Mess & Tilian]
And I'm day-day-daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back
Only I share with the lesson, I'm mocking it
Letting the pear flip its shape
Top of the tumor, it's rumored I'm neutered
A fabulous rape in the taint

[Chorus: Tilian]
I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Stroke my ego, turn me into God
I am God

[Verse 3: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Expecting the people to live in your head
If you knew what to do, then you'd do what you said
Proxy the awesome and seek the deletion
Of reaper repeating submission face
Opt for the option to stop this exhaustion
And breathe through the tube of civility
The end is, the end is, the end is the end of days
And we can get it in the open
Tell me all your secrets, show me how to make you mine
'Cause you got me feeling nervous
Know I don't deserve it, but you're giving me the signs
I bet you never saw me coming
But I've had my eye on you for miles
Just had to get it in the open
Take off all your clothes and, baby, let me blow your mind
Baby, let me blow your mind
'Cause I need it the most, so baby, let me blow your mind

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
And I'll keep hiding in this cul-de-sac
Day-day-daydreaming of a taste I can't hold back
I have something important too

[Chorus: Tilian]
I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved
(Not alone, so alone)
Stroke my ego, turn me into God
Is there a God?

[Intro: Tilian]
Please don't talk about me with all your friends

[Verse 1: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand (I'll never leave you)
Fill up this riddled with curses, old man (So easy to say)
Acting like enemies out of my way (I never loved you)
Still won't break up with the things I have made (Stay the hell out of my way)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Sick of being on my game and understated
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Taken all that I can take, I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Brand new

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
That's it, it's over, I'm done
Give me the keys to the car
Put the pedal to the metal as we're falling apart
And I don't wanna see the phony look on your face
I should have never fallen for it in the first place
Touch me, fool me, tame me, make me all about it
When I bleed, you scream, shame me, I'll leave, over-dramatic
Nah, I don't do that anymore
No people, just places I adore
Too bad I lost the feeling
Leave it alone I'm asleep so I'm healing
All great things have battle scars
You wanna swap this belief with a greater art
My flesh road has only grown into a mattress fit for mounting

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand (I'll never leave you)
Fill up this riddled with curses, old man (So easy to say)
Acting like enemies out of my way (I never loved you)
Still won't break up with the things I have made (Stay the hell out of my way)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Sick of being on my game and understated
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Taken all that I can take, I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Brand new

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I've faced this allergy, it won't go away
Upgraded salary, employment virus aid
I've faced this allergy, it's everything I thought that I could fake

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'll live in the moment, you gave me a reason
Then I fell asleep in the bathroom
Mixing magic potions, looking for a meaning
To get myself out of this costume
Sick and tired of counting bubbles in the ceiling
Feel like a prisoner in my head
I was only trying to forget the feeling
I get when I think of you, oh
Beautiful and tragic, oh
Beautiful and tragic
I see me riding off, off through the clouds (Oh)
I see me riding off, off to the bitter end (Beautiful and tragic)
I see me riding off, off through the clouds (Oh)
I see me riding off, off to the bitter end (Beautiful and tragic)
(I'm so sick)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Sick of being on my game and understated
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Taken all that I can take, I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away and open up with something new
Brand new

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Pop that! Shock and awe!
Get that, grab it, go go claws!
I go broke when I assume I suck
Flex my settlement, I'm selling stuff
Get that, go in raw, have a baby, adopt a dog
Well, I blasted, enacted and off to space
Well, I practiced, adapted and it felt great

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Right now I need somebody
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
A little taste of honey
Legs don't matter, they're just softening, I'm limping
Bugs don't matter, no death is suffering, just squish it
Legs don't matter, they're just softening, I'm limping
Bugs don't matter, no death is suffering, just squish it

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I'm giving in this time
Temptation running wild
Shutting down my mind, oh (Uh-oh)

[Chorus: Tilian]
You got me on the run (Uh-oh)
You know me more than anybody (Uh-oh)
You got me with the gun in my hand (Uh-oh)
But I don't care about anybody but you

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm on a roll, I can't contain myself
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I need a taste
Legs don't matter, they're just softening, I'm limping
Bugs don't matter, no death is suffering, just squish it
Legs don't matter, they're just softening, I'm limping
Bugs don't matter, no death is suffering, just squish it (Uh-oh)

[Chorus: Tilian]
You got me on the run (Uh-oh)
You know me more than anybody (Uh-oh)
You got me with the gun in my hand (Uh-oh)
But I don't care about anybody but you
Don't tell me that we're done (Uh-oh)
I know you more than anybody (Uh-oh)
I'll make it up to you, I swear (Uh-oh)
'Cause I don't care about anybody but you

[Bridge: Tilian]
I got a feeling that you're dropping the bomb tonight
And leaving me on my own
Took all your pictures off the wall and you were cold as ice
When we talked on the phone
If you want it, come home, maybe we could work it out
You know I would take it back if I could
Or we could leave it in the past and try to make it out
Hit the radio and set the mood
I did you wrong, now let me atone
'Cause I don't think we'll make it all alone
Alone (Uh-oh)
Alone (Uh-oh)
Alone

[Outro: Tilian]
I got a feeling that we're here to stay (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Stick with me and I can take you there (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm not about to throw it all away (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Holding on to what we got, so rare (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got a feeling that we're here to stay (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Stick with me and I can take you there (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm not about to throw it all away (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Holding on to what we got, so rare (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hey! (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Hey! (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hey! (Oh-oh-oh-oh, uh-oh)
Hey! (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Intro: Tilian]
It's like it never even happened
I never got to know this side of you
Frozen all connections
Now I can't find the person that was you
Oh no, I can't remember
The leaves were bound to change
I loved you in the summer
The leaves were bound to change

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Why can't I seem to find my mind? The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried and died inside, it's deep and broken up
Host of the feelings left, isn't there
Ran outside to waste his cares
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game, it wasn't me, the world is drunk
I'm a piston on a mission, pumping out my guts

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
She said I was something, like a filler in her molar
A hibernating Siamese twin on her shoulder
I lose my shit enough, I bite a bit off, more than I can chew
You collected fashion tips and now I wear a cage
Stuck in a batters grip, faking a limp
Happy to cry, waiting for gifts, biding my time
I injected apathy, attempt to disengage
Avoiding those parroting, they won't decide a
They won't decide a, they won't decide a
They won't decide a thing

[Refrain: Tilian]
When I saw you there, looking like a shadow
Of what you were, I could see my sorrow

[Chorus: Tilian]
Shining in the moment when you turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around my world
Shining in the moment, hit me with the cold
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm without you, girl
(Snow falling, downpour, falling, downpour)
(Snow falling, downpour, downpour)

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
I'm so sick in the brain (Oh-oh)
I don't even practice keeping in touch
Throw my thoughts in the drain (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
The clutch of Abraxas stone
Torn deep through the rug
Watch my dripping bone erupt (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
As I bellow the message, complete with the flood
When the hot fog rolls on a match and sparks it up (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Ribbon lip quiver, god calling when I've had enough
I'm lost

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Why can't I seem to find my mind? The time is almost up
It's wide, I'm fried and died inside, it's deep and broken up
If had done faster, then I'm spared to sleep instead of suck
Maybe it's time to quit the game, it wasn't me, the world is drunk

[Verse 1: Tilian]
I've got style, I work harder than anyone
And I can do it while I'm having fun
Yeah, I'ma get, I'ma get, I'ma get-get better

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I want to be, I want to be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody
I'm gonna be somebody

[Chorus: Tilian]
Now, now, slow your roll
Keep your head low
Your life is a joke
Don't make this awkward
Lay back in the fold
Can't make it alone
You're too fucking old
Don't make this awkward

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming, I can't help it
But you're a friend
You keep my feet on the ground and my head out of the clouds
Show me how to doubt myself
And who knows where I'd be without you

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Now, now, slow your roll
Keep your head low
Your life is a joke
Don't make this awkward
(The belief is a burden and a crop)
Lay back in the fold
Can't make it alone
You're too fucking old
Don't make this awkward
(Now the dream is only a memory)

[Bridge: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Cry, mine is mine
I clamp my head in the crease of a familiar smell
I think the tree is a thief
I'm frying everything that incubates and ever was
Simmer 15 rips before I croak and die
I flipped that maggot out
I sniffed that dragon's brew
I say I'm feeling it when everyone is on my side
We think we're relevant
Hey, we think we're being admired

[Refrain: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Now and then
I get a little bit full of myself and start dreaming, I can't help it
It's slipping into this
All of you, all the heads inside the hole of cause
We're getting intimate, it's a flu in a vein
How do we disconnect from the arm?
Am I a fool not to run?
You're nicotine in my lungs
How can I trust anyone but you?

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Now, now, slow your roll
Keep your head low
Your life is a joke
Don't make this awkward
(The belief is a burden and a crop)
Lay back in the fold
Can't make it alone
You're too fucking old
Don't make this awkward
(Now the dream is only a memory)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Talk about your feelings? I'm going pitch black
Talk about my feelings? I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me, I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back
Stand up and notify the registry
I'm buying a house in a shit-storm economy
Make love, I plagiarized the books I read
My infinite wisdom, belligerent at lightning speed
I'll go get the decider, I'll be the center divider
I could be more than just, "Hey bro, listen"
I'll be claiming you flagging, I'll be bragging I'm admin
I could fulfill the people's crave for pigskin

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(Who am I kidding?)
And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
(Who am I kidding?)
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me, baby? Get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Prey on my spirit 'til you come alive
Hydrate my fire 'til it smolders out
Can't fight the feeling this is meaningless
Who am I kidding? I can't breathe without...
Oh, it's calling me, I can't turn away
Treat me like a slave, I'll come willingly
Oh, you're the reason I get out of bed
Still can't fight the feeling this is meaningless

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Small world syndrome, I can hear your criticism
B-b-bouncing off the base of my buttons (Meaningless)
You bluffing, I could go get the biggest brick so you could break in
I could constrict the citizen to make a payment
Talk about your feelings? I'm going pitch black
Talk about my feelings? I don't wanna, fuck that
It don't believe me, I mustn't whip that
Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Tilian]
(Who am I kidding?)
And I'm assuming that you're worth it
You would never break my heart
The way you're killing me is perfect
Bleed me out and leave no scar
(Who am I kidding?)
I got a feeling I deserve it
Wanna hurt me, baby? Get in line
The way you're killing me is perfect
Stare until it makes me blind

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Turn up the radio
Give 'em what they want, play their favorite song
Make it sensational
Sing it from the heart, illuminate the dark

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up, come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it

[Chorus: Tilian]
I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Do it for both of us
But march to your own drum 'cause I am old and done
Swear I can feel the rush
Watching you become everything I'm not

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up, come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it now

[Chorus: Tilian]
Strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
To condone this great offense, I address the audience
Our grip is strong or impotent, we're wise to hype this up
Call on the creed and prophesize you'd witness this event
The infant's egg is monetized, a privilege heaven-sent
I made you this way, you have me to thank

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
(Under the spell of it, we're wise to hype this up)
I am every season
(A new former shell of it, I'm wise to hype this up.)
I am legend, all because of you

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
It's that one type of night with the bright white ice pick
Slipped up signature, wrestle 'til I scribble shit
Who in my space smell khaki leather pants?
If my brain go missing, I'll be damned
The one ripped by the wind, instant implant
How we see what we thought was nothing before
Now the lost and the waste can slide beside them
Perform the custom of hissing lisp adorn

[Chorus: Tilian]
I've had a little bit too much (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't wait for me, I'll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine, love, to lubricate my flow (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't wait up for me 'cause I'll be coming home tomorrow

[Verse 2: Will Swan]
I'll crush a mound up on your birthday cake
With your whole family there watching or at your Aunt Viv’s wake
Line up some blow on your titties and blow the rest in your face
If you're not turning up, then your whole life's a disgrace
I like the self-destructive girls, where the fucks be all missin'
When you get home and I'm high, I don't wanna hear no bitching
This is the modern man, modern plan, future transition
Worship the work and the product, American Joy Division

[Interlude: Jon Mess, Tilian & Will Swan]
I know them and I know what
I think I'ma start this up
Eagle vs Crows
(We all suck, we were born to fuck this up)
I know them and I know what
I think I'ma start this up
Eagle vs Crows
(We all suck, we were born to fuck this up)

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
Like the fastest object overgrowth
Like a basket robin, egg and yolk
I got the bombest little habit, watch my head explode
Like the plant lion synthesized this shit

[Chorus: Tilian]
I've had a little bit too much (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't wait for me, I'll wake up on my own tomorrow
I took a little medicine, love, to lubricate my flow (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Don't wait up for me 'cause I'll be coming home tomorrow

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth

[Refrain: Tilian]
I made some mistakes, not so good with planning
But I got some skills in easy living
Cut my ties with desperation and learned to live with a little sensation

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hey, just for the day, we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey, let's make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place, oh, oh, oh
Act like we own the place

[Verse 2: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Swinging back and forth
All my faults are peaking past the surface
Is it worth it to fall back down?
Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent

[Refrain: Tilian]
We're way too caught up in the race with time
It's getting hard to take it in
We're trying hard to be the first in line
Just wanna be a kid again, a kid again

[Bridge: Tilian]
Sick of being in my head and thinkin' about my fate
And worried about my health
Wanna waste away my days with a pretty young thing
And blow through all my wealth
Over, over, overwhelmed again
Singin' out, out
Bury it away

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hey, just for the day, we'll pretend I'm made of money
I'll be your sugar daddy
Hey, let’s make a fool of ourselves and crash a party
Act like we own the place, oh, oh, oh
Act like we own the place

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Killing all the flies, I'm not done swinging back and forth yet
Forgive me for what I will do
Please make way for the special invented armor
Mental protection, if reality is raging harder
Hello, Mister Mime; hello, medicine
I believe denial makes me hella intelligent
I know we trust each other; don't fail the litmus
We all need partners for the pain of existence
My bedroom chemistry set ended up on your Pinterest
Pledging allegiance to a few common interests
Claw my way to the top of the centipede
The sum of its parts is prescribing me symmetry
Every bone picked and decision was orchestrated
Cut the head off and the legs'll call the action complacent

[Intro: Tilian]
We lie cold
Dam up the river we can go slow
We don't wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb

[Verse 1: Tilian]
We take our time ignoring all the signs
Living in fear of our lies
Never bad enough to break it or good enough to feel right
Been in overtime half our lives
Under indecision
We become so dependent
On the rush of the moment
Sanitize my head

[Bridge: Jon Mess & Tilian]
Death murders everything in sight
Beneath the rip in the wind, the pillar push you aside (Head)
If I make way, I can taste your sigh
Just like the cannibal amp, it knows sound is size (Whoa-oh)
“Push me to the brink," I said
Well, that bitch is a creep, it tried to know what I think (Oh)
To breathe out passion or suck in fate
You think the world was made
To wield your weight and bleed out?

[Chorus: Tilian; both]
Am I the reason that you can't look past your future self?
Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt
I know the feeling 'cause I can't keep my mind open now
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Make up your mind, we're running out of time
Doubt is failure by design
I'm burning up, can only take so much
I know you can feel it, it's catching up
It's getting too heavy for both of us

[Refrain: Tilian]
We lie cold
Dam up the river, we can go slow
We don't wanna know
Dull down our senses
Become numb

[Breakdown: Jon Mess]
Mirin myself all by myself
Feel the caress so sweet, done by my hand
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck 'n dodge, stay unaligned, my recognition face
Some get withered, some get fried
I know we talked about the shit we did each time
Polishing this frame of mind, jacked it up an ax to grind
Duck 'n dodge, stay unaligned, my recognition face

[Chorus: Tilian; both]
Am I the reason that you can't look past your future self?
Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt
I know the feeling 'cause I can't keep my mind open now
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Am I the reason that you can't look past your future self?
Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt
I know the feeling 'cause I can't keep my mind open now
Oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess; both]
I am lost (I am lost), need a God (Need a God)
Somewhere to go when it's all over
I am blind (I am blind), give me eyes (Give me eyes)
Kaleidoscope the world in color
Don't have time to meditate the meaning of the rain
Synchronize our memories 'til we all think same way
'Cause I get lost (I get lost), need a god (Need a God)
Help me put my world in order

[Verse: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I don't wanna know the truth
(I conceive a better way to lie)
I just need feel secure again
(The witnesses evaded)
Codify my wasted youth
(Everywhere I look I feel the weight)
So I don't feel this meaningless again
(So wait it out now)

[Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess & Will Swan]
Tickle my animal instincts, survive
Capable, sociable subject, I'm part of the pack
I know a guy somewhere whose got a guy from town
Who knows a guy from around whose gotta die
We crave a greater existence, survive
Attainable, modified purpose, I'm part of the pack
I know a guy somewhere whose got a guy from town
Who knows a guy from around whose gotta die
I know a guy somewhere whose got a guy from town
Who knows a guy from around whose gotta die
Citizen of the world
I called my sister's cousin-uncle-friend
Made sure to trust them time and time again

[Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess; both]
I am lost (I am lost), need a God (Need a God)
Somewhere to go when it's all over
I am blind (I am blind), give me eyes (Give me eyes)
Kaleidoscope the world in color
Don't have time to meditate the meaning of the rain
Synchronize our memories 'til we all think same way
'Cause I get lost (I get lost), need a god (Need a God)
Help me put my world in order

[Outro: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Oh no, he said a bad word
We should burn him at the stake, desecrate his name
Spit on him from high horses, exaggerate the shame
He's ignorant and vulgar
So evil, we can tell, he'll surely rot in hell
A homophobic sociopath, a menace to us all
He'll take the fall
The group is never ending, the group grew from decay
The group is darkness, father, heaven selected the truth as pain
(The fall)
The group is never ending, the group grew from decay
The group is darkness, father, heaven selected the truth as pain

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Back to sloth and sleeping binges
Self-defeating outburst cringes
Thoughts get rusty, creaky hinges
Lost that box of clean syringes
Stuck to the ceiling, I'm in view
Can't shake the notion I'm becoming you
The look from above, same as below
Sign up for high, free dose of low
The Jig is up, I'm the one, manipulate the ones I love
Light my path, reveal the beacon, where's my balance?
Can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking
Stop

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
(Searching for substance)
I lose control of my autonomic mind
(Waiting for the impulse)
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
(Your thoughts intangible)
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
(Around the winding road)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl, don't be so difficult
Come here, let's get physical

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Sinus pressure, getting older
I like weight upon my shoulders
Here I live, inside this CD
Tell your friends he's super creepy
Weirded out a simple human
Confused by words, arrange and move them
Into spaces, apparent meaning
Eat this song, your ears are greedy

[Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Cut out this conversation, desperation
Now, losing admiration, holding onto accidents
(I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim)
What have I done, what have I done?
(I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm)
That calls for your attention?
(I can turn it off again, I can smile on a whim)
What have I done, what have I done?
(I can make believe in him, the function in the algorithm)
That keeps you hanging on?

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian, Jon Mess]
I wear my soul on my sleeve at night
(Searching for substance)
I lose control of my autonomic mind
(Waiting for the impulse)
And I saw the rage burning in your eyes
(Your thoughts intangible)
Follow me down, we'll get paralyzed
(Around the winding road)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Feed into the miracle
Don't be fucking cynical
Hang on, hang on
Don't lose composure now
Hang on, hang on
Girl, don't be so difficult
Come here, let's get physical

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

[Chorus 3: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
It's all that I see

[Chorus 4: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never fold under pressure
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there
Never mind how I got there

[Chorus 1: Tilian]
I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see

[Chorus 2: Jon Mess]
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars
Got a box of lies, gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear
Got a big ass book and I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

[Chorus 3: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
Fall in line with me, it's all that I see, what I believe
It's all that
It's all that I see

[Chorus 4: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never fold under pressure
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
Never mind how I got there

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Fool, your word means shit
My eyes, they wander

[Verse 1: Jon Mess, Jonny Craig]
Not a lotta shit left to break inside the mind of acid-whore
Swallowing your sister’s nightstand
Might cover up the clogging pores
The sound of Master Blaster's tank weapon gun addon, I believe
Every single little child can benefit from smoking weed
You're filling your pockets with my bones
Filling your pockets

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways
Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways
I don’t know much about computers
But I know that you look like a child abuser
Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways
Slow plans, stuck in my bladder, turn yourself sideways
Sideways, sideways

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Move in, take what's not yours, take what I worked for
Slow down, stop me now, you're tearing apart my soul

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
And lately we should be making me
The best type of record for wasting, please
Amazing bark is getting dark
You know that I know, can ride the arc
And lately we should be making me
The present elect is a burning tree
And you know that I know that I can’t be me
So I can be you, and well, you can be me

[Verse 4: Will Swan]
I'm a T.O.Y F.O.R you, on my pleasure principle
We keep it on the down low, 'cause public eyes are sensible
There ain't no outcome without the illusion
That I let you in the first place
Girl, you know what we're doin', this is dirty sex
Back seats, over the tables, under the sheets
At the workplace, on the beach, in the hammock where I sleep
I know it's your birthday, but could you call me up at 3:30?
Damn, okay, where do you want to meet?

[Verse 5: Jonny Craig]
'Cause I know the lonely road it took to get there
And I believed, I believed it at your lonely word
Well, I knew the lonely road it took to get there
Yeah, I believed, I believed it in your lost words
Well, I know the only road it takes to get there
And I only feel it now because I've been there
And I know the lonely road it takes to get there
And I only feel it now because I've been there

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Slow down, stop me now, you're tearing apart my soul
Move in, take what's not yours, take what I worked for
(Lame as well as boring, lame as well as boring)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound
Capitalize when you dumb it down
You defect and I'll be raging on top of my car
You defect and I'll be passed out, covered in tar
A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound
Capitalize when you dumb it down
A thinly veiled guise elected for another new sound
Capitalize when you dumb it down

[Verse 1: Jon Mess, Jonny Craig]
What’s it like to be a marble? Did I get something in your eye?
She’s a referee, and I’m lethally overdosed on pumpkin pie
Yes the future is mount delicious, son
But the leaf changes forms continuum
My destiny is calling me, it says
"Jon Mess, you should own a gun."

Feel the room filling up with smoke
Billowing, billowing up, holding on for the worst
Rise above

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Come on down (Can I get a piece of that?)
I need more in my veins (Uniquely post-relapse)
So who starts the fire?
The whispers start to drip (The quota and balancing act)
The pain of second place (Can I get a piece of that?)

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
What’s it like to be an atheist? Are you okay with suicide?
Well it’s baffling that my ears can bleed
When I see your domestic thighs
Yes, the future is kush and bubblegum
But I prefer wood to linoleum
My destiny is calling me, it says
"You’ll be fine if you take some Tums."

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
I'm letting out, well, I feel like I've dropped it all
I'm letting out, well, I feel that I've rushed it
No slack, no one to pretend, aroused
(I’m angry, believe it, I need this just as much as you)
(It's complicated)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Come on down (Can I get a piece of that?)
I need more in my veins (Uniquely post-relapse)
So who starts the fire?
The whispers start to drip (The quota and balancing act)
The pain of second place (Can I get a piece of that?)

[Intro: Jon Mess]
So far I’ll lay low in pretense and smack your body
Legs up, some hair pull, its retro, oops, I call shotty
So scram and branded, the pylon, it's silver ion
Blowing glass, insurgent mask
The thickest trap door covered in ice

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Stay close, innocent
The signs to hide his scent
No room for ghosts

The lock and legs are set to bank in someone’s home
Salon will place a bet to cut a hairball loan
The lifeless shit of Mess, confusing ice cream cone
If you can’t read my text, then get a mind read phone
It's okay, I have no legs on this bra sailing gen
You? Right, day?

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Oh, jump on top as I wander around
(Get the best of this no-down pre-lay)
Oh, the bed flows as it rocks back and forth
Our bodies start to sort it out
Hey, jump on top as I wander around
(Get the best of this no-down pre-lay)
Oh, the bed flows as it rocks back and forth
Our bodies start to sort it out

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Package this in seedy tones
You mock a painless death, we’ll beat your dome
You’re softly blocking Mess, so fly him home
With a racist comment, the leaky chrome, what’s up?
A toxic note confess, a soap caress
A simple notion, comment for less
But I like my nest, I wanna call it my mess
'Cause the last time I cried, well, I got dressed

[Bridge: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Oh, and I swear this won't end quick
(We came back for this)
It won't
(We came back for this)
Oh, and I swear this won't end quick
(We came back for this)
It won't
(We came back for this)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Oh, jump on top as I wander around
(Get the best of this no-down pre-lay)
Oh, the bed flows as it rocks back and forth
Our bodies start to sort it out
Hey, jump on top as I wander around
(Get the best of this no-down pre-lay)
Oh, the bed flows as it rocks back and forth
Our bodies start to sort it out

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Hold your breath, make them see
(I blamed the fact of my division, so long in temporary places)
And may the one around make the shadow soak up
(The long lost pitch of your invention lay hidden bond inside its place)
How many faces have to crack
Before they realize I'm not coming back?
(When something less will come together and solid walls will fall apart)
How many faces have to crack
Before they realize I'm not coming back?
(When something less will come together and solid walls will fall apart)
How many faces have to crack
Before they realize I'm not coming back?
(So lately piece of mind is setting, when did the weather taste so tart?)
How many faces have to crack
(Will running solve a contradiction of makeshift tomes and revelations)
Before they realize I'm never going to find my place
(The pious price of buying diction, a speech I never should have made)
I'm not coming back, no

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Haha!
Dance Gavin Dance, baby!
Downtown Battle Mountain II!

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
First it's the casting call, but I'm playing basketball
My wife, she notifies that I missed a call on my phone
Now, why are you snooping, when you should be cooking?
If you read my texts one more time
If you fill the pageant bowl, I will be masterful
Well full of liquid comedy, namaste, your baller bag is on its way
Red full of lexicons, polishing Megatron
If you beat the ho, you tell your bros, I need this, yo!

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
Stop and don't panic, I've got a plan
Let's both pretend you didn't take that one night stand, oh
So hide your face, collect your things
This is what we call the walk of shame
Oh, pretty lady, I know the cost at the gate, you're almost there

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Next it's the pinnacle of me being cynical
Can I be the linchpin compelling to judge a lottery?
Baggy and awfully, bumpy and blistery
Brutally homeless and fluffy

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
(So nice, so nice to meet you)

[Bridge: Jonny Craig]
Lift your head for the last time
Lift it higher and higher and high
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
I tell them personal tastes are fine
We've been over this a million times
You'll never unhinge those biased chromosomes alone

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide
(So nice, so nice to meet you)
(So nice, so nice to meet you)

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Sleepy time tea, vote me closer to bigger than Texas times three
I lose the coupons for groceries
And it would suck to be completely equal
What stops your bitch from believing people?
Count your fingers, concretely provide
A double TV to leak you're alive
Propose a loaf timber refluxing gold
As long as I look good when I’m old

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Façade of fascist, bravado elliptical
The smell of Colin in black boxers, mystic mole
Get those electric blue foot things from Dr. Scholls
You need stillocs just to be me

[Break: Jonny Craig]
Feel free to let it out, give it all up

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Accept your face is so upset old
Bitching same ole, don’t make me cold
Rape the bank for your bail out gold
Licking tricks are for 10 year olds
Missing lips are like lip tip bedsores
You can bounce on me, I just said so
We can fry it, don’t shit my bed though
It’s a fallacy, I like meatloaf

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
I'm so fed so fed I'm green
I'm so fed so fed I'm green
I'm so fed so fed I'm green
I gave my liver to the football team
I don’t do no, do no, do no sluts
I don’t do no, do no, do no sluts
I don’t do no, do no, do no sluts
I got acid that I gargle for a fresh brain stump

[Verse 5: Jon Mess]
Sock full of wood I’m painting flesh tones
I thought you drank my locket full of glue
Don’t wanna sit cross legged in a circle
I won't wear, shirts that are pink or purple?
I thought you knew, my locket full of glue
Was really coke, coke I bought from Urkel
I thought you drank my locket full of glue
Once again I don’t wear pink or purple

[Verse 6: Jon Mess]
Resounding yes as my eyes leak out an eagles skull
Bludgeoning a mitten, meticulous self-control
I need these priests to stop molesting your kids backdoor
It's fucking disgusting man
The wrong religion well you have selected
Nuclear launch detected
The wrong religion well you have selected
Nuclear launch detected

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
Day one the lights fade, the music's full of bass
She's all up in my face, I can't believe she's so close
Feeling her grind made me lose my mind
I'm just plain old take home material, take home material

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
I keep my fingers crossed
Hoping to find a way to show you what I'm made of
Throw all our worries to the wind

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
I backtracked, stabbed at you
Followed the tracks to a cabin filled with wooden spoons
Then a shred of lead ripped my hoodie in two
There’s no telling what my evil twin brother wouldn’t do

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig]
I wake up drenched in sweat
Wondering who I'm lying with
What a joke, there's nothing left to explore

[Chorus: Jonny Craig & (Jon Mess)]
Find myself at the end of a bottle
Laying in your bed hoping to find out where I'm at
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)
And it's gone away my song so long
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)

[Hook: Jon Mess]
Accept fresh, fresh can of broccoli
I can't hear you when you are knocking
Unless fresh, fresh can of broc'
I’ll be leaning towards a centimeter short of much
Accept fresh, fresh can of broccoli
I can't hear you when you are knocking
Unless fresh, fresh can of broc'
I’ll be leaning towards a centimeter short of much

[Verse 5: Jonny Craig]
As the sun goes down baby I'm in town
Hopin' to find someone to take it all
I know I'm right when I say go away
You get around, oh. you get around, oh
You get around, oh, you're busy fucking everyone
Busy fucking everyone, oh you're busy fucking everyone

[Chorus: Jonny Craig & (Jon Mess)]
Find myself at the end of a bottle
Laying in your bed hoping to find out where I'm at
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)
And it's gone away, my song, so long
(The weight can make you trip, but you won't fall down)

[Bridge: Jonny Craig]
Feeling my heart race
Drenched in sweat
As I wonder
I'm not scared, not prepared
Lay down flat on your back
Open up girl let's play a tad
Let's waste our time

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Back on top, but my blocks mowed down
Man I’m fit
Yeah my stomachs never touched the ground
But I’m courteous
Still keep it real with my nerdiness
14th’s my birthday
Her's is on the 30th
If you were dead I bet this shit would bloom
Get a standing ovation from an empty room
Fuck your ass
I don’t want your cereal
You can get your wig split back
I'll be the same O.G

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I'm a horrible shot, I tie a horrible knot
I pushed a bunch of little people over once
Well a rest is best when you stress a test
And you forget all about your aching ass
I'm a horrible shot, I tie a horrible knot
I muck ace a lot, I'm gonna pace the lot
Don’t be tardy for my leaky Barbie TV party pee in the park

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well I can't believe, you're better off alone
You stood near stone
And I can't believe, I'm better than you know
I felt the rush of no control
And it feels so good, and it feels so good, it feels so nice
Now turn your back, cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back, cause I'm gonna be all up on you
Placing a bet, my odds of you and me, zero
Being a vet, I know that you are too fearful
Placing a bet, my odds of you and me, zero
We can regret, all the things we could be doing instead

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I’m peeling into the house
Gotta run to the basement
Gotta establish a connection before I get impatient
I’m no contortionist man, I’ll steal the lips off your eyes
But anyone who really matters got a call from my guy

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
I can't believe, I can't believe that I can't breathe
I can't believe, I can't believe that I didn't see
See the smoke in my eyes, feel the pain in my lungs now go
See the smoke in my eyes, feel the pain in my lungs now go

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
Reset this best of four I know
You’ve been waiting by the telephone I know
But it’s not how or why I lie
You think I wanna be a mediocre guy
Reset this best of four I know
You’ve been waiting by the telephone I know
But it’s not how or why I lie
You think I wanna be a mediocre guy

[Verse 5: Jonny Craig]
See the cracks in my skin, feel the ground on my feet, now go
See the cracks in my skin, feel the ground on my feet, now go
I know one girl that's not gonna get home tonight
I know one girl that's not gonna get home

[Verse 6: Jon Mess with Will Swan]
Heat seeking ghost of sex
Don’t pay attention to my mild case of blow tourettes
What
I probably placed a bet, took your missing tooth
There’s no people left in line for your kissing booth
I always knew all of the things that you thought you think
Twice times I’ll probably tell you that your god's a geek
Point and glide till your ostracized
Then pile patterns on my beak cause right now it's innovation week
(Innovation, innovation, innovation week)
(Innovation, innovation, innovation week)
(Innovation, innovation, innovation week)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well I can't believe, you're better off alone
You stood near stone
And I can't believe, I'm better than you know
It feels so good
Now turn your back, cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back, cause I'm gonna be all up on you
Placing a bet, my odds of you and me, zero
Being a vet, I know that you are too fearful
Placing a bet, my odds of you and me, zero
We can regret, all the things we could be doing instead

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Ooooh

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
Let's start it over
As I comb, back and forth
Through the causes of my mistakes
Well you said it over and over
Don't come back, don't come around my kids
Well I'm already in
And we all

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
You'll go far on the back of a potato
Making French fries in the snow
Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow
You'll be red, you'll be gold
Then you'll steal
Then you'll steal
Then you'll steal
Then you're right, somebody getting farther than getting to the better of the betting, alright?
Then you're right, somebody getting farther than getting to the better of the betting, alright?

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
Smooth, out the streets
Move, your feet
Let it out, let it out
Let it out
Place, the blame on my head
Let it out, Let it out
Give it all!

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down
Give in, give it, give it all. Slow it down

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
You'll go far on the back of a potato
Making French fries in the snow
Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow
You'll be red, you'll be gold
Then you'll steal
Then you'll steal
Then you'll steal
Then you're right, somebody getting farther than getting to the better of the betting, alright?
Then you're right, somebody getting farther than getting to the better of the betting, alright?

[Bridge: Jonny Craig]
Stop, let it go, oh wonder
Stop, let it go, oh wonder
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo don't move
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo don't move
Baby, stay put
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo don't move
Doo, doo, doo, don't move
Baby stay

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Hey! Well I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Well I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Hey! I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Well I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Hey!I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you, stay
Hey man, I'm bumping bleedo
Blee blee doe

[Outro Skit: Jonny Craig & female]
Hello?
Hello... What color are your fucking eyes?
Mine?
Yeah
Blue
They're blue for sure, right?
Yeah
Alright, bye!
Alright let's go

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Feel light as it flows
And flows

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, (Will Swan)]
Can't hide the fact that we're both here
(Runnin' rampant round town with my head in the ground
But that’s just s-u-p-p-o-s-e)
Don't let it go, we're so scared
(How it’s suppose to be
Me in the trunk making audible thumps)
Draw the line, he knows
(And we break and we dip and we crash and we fly
But it’s not really a big deal, I’m a tolerable guy)
Peel back the book for a while
(In the age of piss when the old man whistles
Yeah I’m late, but don’t remind me of our separate pistols)

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I’m ballistically drunk, I’m a triumphant lump
I’m an instant glow ball coffee syrup florist filled gunk
That beat is mystically drunk, I’m a triumphant lump
I’m an instant glow ball coffee syrup de clog your gunk
De clog your gunk
De clog your gunk
Gunk, drunk, gunk, drunk

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
It's only funny in the back side of love
Well I won't let it break my self-esteem
Oh, it's only funny in the back side of love
We'll open our graves

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Move on, I caught you instantly
Move on, you stomping elephant
Move on, I caught you instantly
Move on, you stomping elephant

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig]
But I'd hate to say no
When it comes to those beautiful blue eyes
And I'd hate to say no
When it comes to those beautiful fuckin' eyes
Hold on girl, well, I promise that we'll have it all
Hold on girl, well, I promise that we'll have it all

[Break]
Hello I will talk to you, I have some things to go over with
Are you mad or spectacular?
Yes, yes so so so so fifi fifi
Yes but my face has been melted
Hello? I will talk to you
Are you mad or spectacular?

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
It's only funny in the back side of love
Well I won't let it break my self-esteem
It's only funny in the back side of love
We'll open our graves

[Outro: Jon Mess]
You’ve got loud as fuck sighs
You know how to fake cry
You’ve got that ostrich beak that’s lowering your skill in sneak
You’ve got loud as fuck sighs
You know how to fake cry
You’ve got that ostrich beak that’s lowering your skill in sneak
You’ve got loud as fuck sighs
You know how to fake cry
You got you got you got you got me

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Oaken rod system show me sloping earlobes
The patient unlisted bit my lip sir
Basing the feeling off weed, Go!
But my Achilles is a shortly written poem
Go loco, slow from dro, broke your nose
Scraping my bristle missile, Go!

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
My cost is cheap
My words are deep
Cutting right through your soul
It's sad to see the lights burn out
It's sad to see the lights burn out
It's sad to see you run away
My words unchanged

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Another sucker punch
You were late for dinner, I was late for lunch
You wanna know the truth?
I eat alotta soup
What’s it like to punch a drum
So belong and hold it tightly son
You wanna know the truth?
I eat alotta soup

[Break: Jonny Craig]
Oh, no

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
Such slow stoic teeth of mine
Box him in, Uncle Leo is between your thighs
Your soak in rusting these slope driven pots 'n pans
No time to rush him, delete my deleted land
Yo who proves to me to believe what you need without me
Who proves to believe in me
Yo who proves to believe without me
Don’t believe that you’re with me, just to believe
Just to and just to and just to and just to believe

[Chorus 1: Jonny Craig]
Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with water
Still hang on my every word
Because I promise I'm coming back

[Verse 5: Jon Mess]
I blocked your three point shot, you get caught napping a lot
Your handles worse than Chris A. when he’s high on pot
You’re like an epileptic version of a ballet dancer
KG might say that you have cancer

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig]
Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with water
Still hang on my every word
Because I promise I'm coming back
Blow up your lungs
Let your mouth fill with water
Still hang on my every word
Because I promise it's gonna be your last

[Chorus 1: Jonny Craig]
Don't bother, I'm a danger to my health
Don't bother, I'm a danger to
Don't bother, I'm a danger
Don't bother, I'm a danger to your health

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
So I'm baking a cake, got this badass oven filled with goodies and treats
For all of my friends
Then Jonny comes and he poisons the food
Everyone is dead, now wasn't that rude

[Break: Jonny Craig]
I am

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig with Jon Mess]
For now, because the words are meaningless
For now, because I am
For now, because the words are meaningless
And we crack all our backs to relax and recap
The one time I looked like the goddamn circus
For now, because I am
And we break into bits to believe we're legit
The one time I looked like the goddamn circus

[Bridge 1: Jonny Craig]
Nobody will ever take the things in my fucked up brain
No one can ever take the holes in my life
Take my life, because these words, they'll never speak
Take my life, falling apart for you
Take my life, ... my eyes will never speak, maybe- take my life, hate, my eyes will never speak
Take one ..., help me into you, maybe-- take one love, help me into you
Come away, go away

[Chorus 1: Jonny Craig]
Don't bother, I'm a danger to
Don't bother, I'm a danger

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig with Jon Mess]
For now, because the words are meaningless
For now, because I am
For now, because the words are meaningless
And we crack all our backs to relax and recap
The one time I looked like the goddamn circus
For now, because I am
And we break into bits to believe we're legit
The one time I looked like the goddamn circus

[Bridge 2: Jonny Craig]
Help me to grow and soar, stand up
Help me to win, drop the words that come from my mouth
Go and find the words
You're speaking in tongues
Go, drop the words that help me they come from my mouth

[Outro: Jon Mess]
I got a sense that this is overdone
But at least we're having fun
Am I right?
I got a sense that this is overdone

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
What excuses do you make?
Happiness is hard to find
I didn't catch a break
Maybe I am dying inside

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
February, been so lonely
It's been so long since I felt your touch
And I couldn't care less if I deserve this
I will never survive the sting inflicted

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis &  Will Swan]
Sever the ties, follow procedure
Pledge abstinence, fuck at your leisure
Breathe in then out, but not out then in
Cause over function, restart again
I need to see my dreams as I close my eyes
Remembering nothing and begging for light

[Verse 3: Will Swan]
All the trees, all the birds and this thing called life
I’d stake it all for forty acres and a trophy wife
Dust gathers on the books that contain our past
And we’re but peons in a circuit built by time to last
Repeat, repeat, as we’ve done before
Our history all lost in war
When the last of our cities are but powder and dust
The damned who remain live with God in the glory of us

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
February's, been so lonely
It's been so long since I felt you
I couldn't care less if I deserve this
I won't survive the sting inflicted

[Outro: Will Swan & Kurt Travis]
Repeat, repeat, as we've done before
Our history all lost in war
Repeat, repeat, as we've done before
Our history all lost in war
Repeat, repeat
Repeat, repeat
Repeat, repeat
Repeat, repeat

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis, Will Swan]
Staring at the window panes
Russian roulette with some names on the phone
When I stare at your face, are you even alive?
Oh my god, you're so fucking intelligent
Don't you just love the use of Andy Warhol
We always knew that we were never the best advocates
And it's okay if I'm gray today

[Verse 2: Will Swan]
Holy fuck, I'm impressed!
Too bad I don't have a pussy to plunge in
While I sit here and stomach this
Here's a Nobel prize, let's gamble our demise

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
Staring at the window panes
Russian roulette with some names on the phone
Hey you, where you from?
Nevermind, just leave me alone

[Verse 4: Will Swan]
I drained the wells so the town has no water
I cut the phone lines and buried the grain
I drained the blood from the fortunate ones
It's self-destruction, 'cause we're all the same

[Verse 5: Will Swan & Kurt Travis]
Hurry up, trade in your gold for cash
That's what everyone's saying
Don't blame me for post-economical backlash
That's what everybody's doing
Sometimes I can't believe myself
Consequence in the purest form
I've seen it coming from miles away

[Break]

[Outro: Kurt Travis & Will Swan]
I'm down with brown town
I'm down with brown town
I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away
I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away
I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away
I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away
I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Maybe we're not the only ones
Let's just say we're the admitted
Let's make believe that we are capable of parallel galaxies
How and why?
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied
How and why?
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis, Will Swan]
Beautiful girls with no ambition
Piling hair at the fucking salon
Happily managing all of their friends
You can't live life through your cellular phone
I told you I don't need you, baby, I need you
(Kurt, cut your loose ends)
I don't need you, baby, I need you
(Man, cut your loose ends)
I don't need you, baby, I need you
(Don't follow the trends)
I told you I don't need you
I can't decide, I can't decide

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
No, it's okay, you don't need them anyway
And if I go, you can stay, everything will be the same
(It was the first time, but it won't be the last)
No, it's okay, you don't need them anyway
(It was the first time, but it won't be the last)
And if I go, you can stay, everything will be the same

[Bridge: Kurt Travis]
I can make you laugh, but I know it won't last
When the air is thin I know you'll be over this again
I know you'll be over me someday

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Maybe we're not the only ones
Let's just say we're the admitted
Let's make believe that we are capable of parallel galaxies
How and why?
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied
How and why?
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
There's no sense in me staying, then why does it matter?
(It doesn't matter, it never matters)
I hope someday soon maybe we'll finish this chapter
(I can't ever finish this chapter)
And now at this moment, I don't know what else to think
There's no sense in me saying, "I guess I still miss you."

[Verse 2: Will Swan]
So, now I need names and faces
Examine the suspects, get the DA here now
You'll tell everyone that it's so much fun
Say to all my friends, "it never ends!"
While we're driving through all the alleyways
We picked up some happiness on the way

[Kurt Travis]
I'll tell everyone that it's so much fun
Say to all your friends, "it never ends."
While we're driving through all the alleyways
I picked up some happiness on the way

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Can we just take a fucking break?
'Cause I feel like I have got nothing left, nothing left

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else should we do
When talking's for functioning people?
I guess I still miss you
But talking's for functioning people
I guess I still miss you, whoa

[Chorus 3: Kurt Travis]
You'd always said we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known that I had it all along
But I didn't know 'til you were gone

[Bridge: Will Swan]
Let's see you function now
Touch your nose, jump around
Footprints, in God we trust
Jes-You, Jes-Me, Jes-Us
Pick up, ten-sack, Orange Crush
Two bottles, cups, and blunts
What do scorned lovers do?
Dancing with all my crew
Drink and drive life away
Gamble with everyday

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Just because you move your hips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Just because you move your lips
Doesn't mean that you exist
Can we just take a fucking break?
'Cause I feel like I have got nothing left, nothing left

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
I guess I still miss you
Oh well, it's me and you
What else should we do
When talking's for functioning people?
I guess I still miss you
But talking's for functioning people
I guess I still miss you, whoa

[Chorus 3: Kurt Travis]
You'd always said we'd win the lottery someday
So I wouldn't have to go away
I should have known that I had it all along
But I didn't know 'til you were gone

[Outro: Kurt Travis]
You'd always say we’d win the lottery someday
So I wouldn’t have to go away
You'd always say we’d win the lottery someday
So I wouldn’t have to go away

[Intro: Kurt Travis]
Drowning in the lake
I only left her for a couple of seconds
And now she's gone

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
Waking up for what?
As I pace back and forth
Maybe it's time to move away
But what would that prove anyway?

[Pre-Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Listening to the answering machine
Over and over
Only to hear your voice one more time
Just one more time

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)
It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
Beg me for directions
Like I have all the answers
I neglected her life
Now what, what do I do with mine?

[Pre-Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Listening to the answering machine
Over and over
Only to hear your voice one more time
Just one more time

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)
It's not your fault, that's what they all keep saying
(That's what they all keep saying)
Blaming myself, there's nothing left
Why do I bother praying?
(Why do I bother praying?)

[Outro: Kurt Travis]
Drowning in the lake
I only left her for a couple of seconds
(Drowning in the lake)
(I only left her for a couple of seconds)
I only left her for a couple of seconds
(Drowning, drowning)

[Verse 1: Will Swan]
One day, I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything
One day, I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything
One day, I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything
One day, I'll tap your mind and I'll know everything

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
No one believes me
No one believes me
They're always on your side, every time
And are you right? And are you right?
A backseat driver, you're driving me insane
I happen to know exactly where I'm going

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
What's your agenda?
What's your agenda?
What's your agenda?

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
No one believes me
No one believes me
No one believes me
No one believes me

[Chorus 1 : Kurt Travis]
Please, girl, stay 'til the early mornin'
We can have some coffee, you can do my laundry
Please, girl, stay, don't mind the clutter
Get back in bed, yeah
Mickey Mouse covers, oh girl, on your body
Please, girl, stay, oh, darlin'
Please, girl, stay, oh, sugar

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
And I'm not really sure what we did last night
So let's explore each others minds
And I know that you can find the time, indulge me
Your cherry lips linger on mine
I took the plum right from the vine
Oh girl, I wouldn't waste your time, indulge me

[Chorus 3: Kurt Travis]
(Please, girl, stay..)
And I'm not really sure what we did last night

All along the watchtower
They'll be singing our song forever
All along the watchtower
They'll be singing our song forever

[Chorus 5: Kurt Travis]
One day, you'll see what it means to breathe
One day, you'll see what it means

[Chorus 1 : Kurt Travis]

One day, you'll see what it means

[Intro: Kurt Travis]
(Oh) Oh! Yeah!
Oh! Yeah!
(Oh) Save me
(Yeah) I think I need some therapy
(Oh) Save me
(Yeah) I think I need some therapy

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Talk on the phone, telling everybody that we're gonna have a real good time (good time)
And we don't care if it gets a little rowdy, everything is gonna be alright (alright)

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
Hey, so glad you made it, did you bring your friends?
(Did you bring your friends? Did you bring your friends?
Did you bring your friends?)
Hey, it's a party baby, hope it never ends

Hey, so glad you made it, did you bring your friends?

Don't you need me? And I need some of that body
Oh, girl, touch me; pop a little some of that bubbly
Don't you need me? And I need some of that body

[Break: Kurt Travis]
Ah yeah
Alright, alright, alright, alright ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm on fire (It's alright)
I'm on fire (It's alright)

And we don't care if...

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Could you stay a little longer?
I could really use the extra time
I don’t know why I even care
'Cause I’m never really there
I’m sure he must be a real nice guy
What a relief, he’ll carry you to sleep

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
(Hey!) And I don’t know
(Hey!) What we could have done
(Hey!) And maybe this time I will learn to love again
(Hey) I will always be your friend

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
See, this is why we don’t talk anymore
'Cause you’ll always be waiting to settle the score
And every second could be the next meltdown
If I wasn’t leaving you wouldn’t make a sound
You wouldn’t make a sound

[Bridge: Kurt Travis]
So this is why we don’t talk anymore
So this is why we don’t talk anymore
Now I don’t have to be a real nice guy
What a relief

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
(Hey!) And I don’t know
(Hey!) What we could have done
(Hey!) And maybe this time I will learn to love again
(Hey) I will always be your friend

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Could you stay a little longer?
I could really use the extra time
I don’t know why I even care
'Cause I’m never really there
I’m sure he must be a real nice guy

[Outro: Kurt Travis]
Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?
Could you stay a little longer?

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
You threw me away, just like all the others
It's been seven days and not a single word
You threw me away just like all the others
(And for you it's all the same, all the same)
(And for you it's all the same, all the same)
It's been seven days and not a single word
(And for you it's all the same, all the same)
(And for you it's all the same, all the same)

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Make everything happen exactly like our love
Just like the ones before, just like the ones before
I hope you know what you are doing to yourself, to yourself
I hope you know what you are doing

[Hook: Kurt Travis]
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same

[Bridge 1: Will Swan]
I see comfort, you see security
I see comfort, you see security

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
You threw me away just like all the others
It's been seven days and not a single word
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive?
It's just the same, the same as yesterday
Don't wake me up if you have nothing to say
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive?

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis]
Make everything happen exactly like our love
Just like the ones before, just like the ones before
I hope you know what you are doing to yourself, to yourself
I hope you know what you are doing

[Verse 2: Will Swan]
What are you but a yellow-purple zebra?
Contacts so I can see clearer?
Write these words in stone, I'm a magnet;
Cause tension and retract it
Please ask me again, 'cause I didn't hear it
Get settled in, 'cause you can't be here yet
All partied out on strangers favors
How you act like my friend but we're only neighbors
Excuse me, pardon the eruption
I walk up, press all the buttons
I'll talk down, stress all the functions
I always gotta be startin' something
So, "powder to the people"
'Cause the fight for rights is equal
"Powder to the people"
'Cause the fight for rights is equal

[Hook: Kurt Travis]
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same
And for you it's all the same, all the same

[Chorus 2: Kurt Travis]
You threw me away just like all the others
It's been seven days and not a single word
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive?
It's just the same, the same as yesterday
Don't wake me up if you have nothing to say
Who chooses to keep all these bohemian thoughts alive?

[Outro: Will Swan]
Content with who we are
Driving our fast cars
Through thin lanes on long roads
So much to behold
Greatest country? Where you been
To form that opinion?
See it, believe it: celebrity leadership

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Stop! The first one to hit the cop wins!
His death was so obvious
Make up the things that you did
I hid in the bushes, I was tripping on thizz
Description of no, sir, you can't ignore
The lights, they are blinding
And you, man, are such a bore
Please smash the target, please smash the target
Please smash the target right where the heart sits

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
Whoever said we had to stop this from happening?
My plans changed abruptly and you chose to flee this unstable setting

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
And I'll only survive in this life
I got that necklace, I got that watch
I copped that blow torch off your front porch
I'll only survive if it's you by my side
I got that bottle of Jack, I got five on that sack
And I'll only survive in this life
If this fails then I'll bail you out of jail
It's so obvious, you're constantly blocking me from rational thinking

[Verse 4: Jon Mess, Jon Mess & Kurt Travis]
Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed, I pluck your feathers
We should fucking be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for

Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed, I pluck your feathers
We should fucking be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for

[Verse 5: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Brace me, honey, I need friction
If I slur my words, correct my diction
It's not always fact or fiction
I made the plan, I'll make my own plan
Period, colon, grammar arsenal
I think we need some brand-new barstools
A new decor, oh, man, that car's cool
I change the plan, I bought my own plan

The night was innocent, but she'll never believe that I was alone
The night was innocent!
Reciting words I didn't write
You want a piece of my mind
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine
You want a piece of my mind, that's fine

[Break: Kurt Travis]
Just keep your arms around me and I won't let your body touch...
I won't let it touch the ground
Just keep your eyes on me and let me be your gravity

[Outro: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Until you can, can sleep sound
(You're right, I am addicted)
Until you can, can sleep sound
(The point, I guess I missed it)
Until you can, can sleep sound
(It's not your fault)
(But I'll blame it on anything but myself)
Until you can, can sleep sound
(You're right, I am addicted)
Until you can, can sleep sound
(The point, I guess I missed it)
Until you can, can sleep sound
(It's not your fault)
(But I'll blame it on anyone but myself)

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Here is a lesson: stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like no, no, no, no, no!
Question answer question, no question, answer question
No one cares who you know, know, know, know, know, know
Here is a lesson: stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like no, no, no, no, no, no!
Know who you are before you claim you're a star
For now we are all just like no, no, no and no

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
And all that you said to me has left me with anxiety
Let's just keep this underneath
You speak of me in disbelief

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
This ain't no fucking day job
I don't just sit around counting all my money
This is how you go out
I don't just sit around counting all my money
This is how you go out, you go out like a bang
I envision your brain like a crashing car
The cable, it just snaps, holding up the elevator
This ain't no fucking day job, I don't just sit around
This is how you go out, you go out like a bang

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Here is a lesson: stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like no, no, no, no, no!
Question answer question, no question, answer question
No one cares who you know, know, know, know, know, know
Here is a lesson: stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like no, no, no, no, no, no!
Know who you are before you claim you're a star
For now we are all just like no, no, no and no

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Hello, my name is Jon-fucking-Mess
I wrote the script on getting you out of your dress
Would you like to go out sometime?
I'll tear open your body and break down your emotional guard
Cause I like love, and it's no good to me if you don't reciprocate the feeling
If you don't give back, I'm crushed, I'll go out drinking

[Intro: Jon Mess]
Ask me, I'm fine, or I will be
I got a bulletproof vest on and the cure for AIDS
And a pill that makes me happy
Ask me, I'm fine, or I will be
I've got the cure for loneliness
And a pill that makes all my problems resolved

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I've got a bulletproof vest on and I wiretapped your brain
I want to do this right, dyno, dyn-o-mite

[Pre-Chorus: Kurt Travis]
You should have just listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now
I thought we told each other to live in different worlds

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Oh, you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now, over this by now
(Well it sure is complicated, but I still know)
Oh, there's only so much I can take
But I guess we'll never really find out, never really find out
(That I can get frustrated and snort that blow)

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Rate me and judge me on a graph that you drew
Hope I compare to the friends that left you for dead

[Bridge: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
How many times, how many times
How many times is this gonna happen?
How many times, how many times
How many times is this gonna happen?
I've got to blame all these people
As fast as I motherfucking can
You were fooled, this ain't no fucking day job

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Oh, you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now, over this by now
(Well it sure is complicated, but I still know)
Oh, there's only so much I can take
But I guess we'll never really find out, never really find out
(That I can get frustrated and snort that blow)

[Outro: Kurt Travis]
Suddenly, we startle ourselves
Staring upon each other in silence, silence
To think this whole time we're provoking each other in blinding violence

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Won the battle, so now buy me clothes
Let's make believe that we're better off alone
Well it's me I implore, I store smiles down in the basement
Even in a perfect world we could not breathe

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Now I'm choosing my battles
Now I'm herding the cattle
Now I'm choosing my battles
I am the sow

[Kurt Travis & Jon Mess]
You remind me of someone
You remind me of someone else
You remind me of someone
You remind me of someone else

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
We could not get up here, the stairs have collapsed on top of us
No one said it was my responsibility, well, I'll get this done
We are up on our backs, helpless, in fact, but slowly moving
Nine to five we slave for people that are underage
Well I'm slowly moving
I'm slowly moving
Oh, it's the best feeling, thinking of your new goals in life
And I never wanted this to happen, but it always does

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
It's so funny when you speak of love so fluently
(I saved the gats for you and I)
You have ruined me (Decide!)
When will this end?
(I saved the gats for you and I)
When will this end? (Decide!)

[Verse 4: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
We've got to save the weekends for getting our minds blown out
We've got to find the best way for shutting their fucking mouths
When will this end? When will this fucking end?
Well, Judgement Day is Tuesday, so get your rabbit foots out

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Won the battle, so now buy me clothes
Let's make believe that we're better off alone
Well it's me I implore, I store smiles down in the basement
Even in a perfect world we could not breathe

[Outro: Kurt Travis & Jon Mess]
It's like we've never felt so...
I'll drive the boat, I'll drive the boat
It's like we've never felt so...
I'll drive the boat, I'm arming the laser
It's like we've never felt so...
Never felt so great, never felt so gold
What it's like to never felt so, felt so, felt so...
Gold, it hurts
Diamond flavor

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
If we could only be in different places
Among the same faces we can't forget
In debt to the very distinction of love and hate
They're both in our hearts, we choose an imbalance
Oh, the thought, we are the flaws that make us

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
That must be why I'm suffering
What's the right word for this?
Ashamed? No, horrified
It's an action, delayed reaction
I've got taxes and bills to pay
Something's flapping its wings at me
Someone's clapping, I guess we're on TV

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Stop now you've ruined it all
Stop now you've obtained it all
Stop now you've ruined it all
Stop now you've obtained it all
Stop now you've ruined it all
Stop now you've obtained it all
Stop now, stop now
Stop now, stop now
Stop now, stop now
Stop now, stop now
Stop now, stop now
(Indefinitely)

[Verse 4: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Moving in the right direction
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me
Or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
Maybe I'll sleep, maybe I'll sleep through a century
I'm waiting to see if it comes to me
Or if it's tied to a safe that just hit the sea floor
What was going through my head?
Head

[Verse 5: Jon Mess]
Press the pressure point on my neck
My head will snap off and roll into the secret passage
We built for escorting the rapist to the victim
Did you manage your time? Do you know how I do?
Downpour, downpour, downpour, downpour
Oh, the boredom involved in patience

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
And so I'll make a fist and rip the threads we've sewn
Since it's come to this, it feels like nobody's home
So my cover's blown, rip open the threads we've sewn
And so I'll make a fist and rip the threads we've sewn
Since it's come to this, it feels like nobody's home
So my cover's blown, rip open the threads we've sewn
And I won't forget what it means

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
To feel her touch
It's almost impossible to hold still
Maybe we can go back to the way it was
Well, at least let me love you the same

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess, & Nic Newsham]
I've got lies to tell your children
When my smile pierces through your bones
Right through your bones (Through your bones)
The grass is green inside my yard
I can make you laugh so fucking hard
It hurts you inside your bones (Inside your bones)

[Verse 2: Nic Newsham]
When she talks, I listen
She's in the shower and her skin glistens
Like, oh my god, I like it
Like, oh, oh god, I like it
I suggest a drive, let's take the backroad
Let's get lost, let's lose our minds
Hey, little girl, I think we found it tonight
I think we glow that fucking bright, oh
And when she laughs I like it
Like oh-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess, & Nic Newsham]
I've got lies to tell your children
When my smile pierces through your bones
Right through your bones (Through your bones)
The grass is green inside my yard
I can make you laugh so fucking hard
It hurts you inside your bones (Inside your bones)

[Chorus 2: Nic Newsham, Kurt Travis]
Holy shit, she smells like heaven
Been best friends since we were eleven
And oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
Baby, I thought that we had something
Compared to him I'm next to nothing
And, oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
I am a million fucking bucks
I am a thousand fucking fucks
Your bitch is dead, she was hit by a truck
What the fuck?

[Chorus 2: Nic Newsham, Kurt Travis]
Holy shit, she smells like heaven
Been best friends since we were eleven
Oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
Baby, I thought that we had something
Compared to him I'm next to nothing
And, oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Is trust really that fucking hard? (A gesture of faith in me)
You make it sound when you let go within the circle
(Blasphemy so regularly, right?)
Everyone knows what you wear
That face of doubt to live without
(Honestly we're deceiving each other)

[Chorus: Chino Moreno, (Kurt Travis), and Jon Mess]
You think of awe, (it's not enough)
And take every word from me
Fighting everyone that I see
Learning when and where not to be
You speak of awe, (it's not enough)
And make every word taste sweet

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
Why don't you just let me live my life?
I've given you more of myself, it's hard to get that back
Go and make me believe that I feel complete
Better suite my manic depressive desires

[Chorus: Chino Moreno, (Kurt Travis), and Jon Mess]
You think of awe, (it's not enough)
And take every word from me
Fighting everyone that I see
Learning when and where not to be
You speak of awe, (it's not enough)
And make every word taste sweet

[Outro: Chino Moreno, Kurt Travis]
Would you like us to wave off every battle?
(My invasion is your caviar)
To wave off every battle
(My invasion of thoughts is your caviar)
Stronger, longer, faster, blonder

[Intro: Jon Mess]
The first thing I say in the morning is, "Fuck that shit."
People are offended and tired, so fuck that shit
I walk myself to my church service and ask for this:
Balance my brain chemicals, so I can give a shit
(Shit)

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis & (Jon Mess)]
Stay back, and don't make advances
I'll keep my side of the trade
(Here is a blatant remark)
And I thought forbidden contacts were in order
(Contacts were in order)
(I'll never get arrested)
This is all for the opposition, for the opposition

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Make it right
Put your soul on ice
Give a chance to make this better
Make it right
Put your soul on ice
Let's wait to pull that lever
Make this right
Put your soul on ice
I need to make this better
Make this right
Put your soul on ice
But I still make this wrong

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
I get hyphy on such a decadent mixture
Man, we're back again
But I'm only here for just one more show
Feel the back of my hand
Feeling alone on such a decadent mixture
Wanna hit ya, get your picture and just take you home
Record banter
We make post parole

[Break: Jon Mess]
And then, and then I took the keys right out of the ignition
And I, and I ran, broke out, down, running down the street
Looking for the where the hell, where the hell can I hide?
People, people try to ask me questions, man
I don't know the fucking answers
I, I just got this rock
I just got this rock
Rock solid

[Bridge: Matt Geise]
Raise your hand if the system has missed you, man
Your money ain't going as far as it used to
Raise your hand if the system has missed you, man
Raise your hand
Raise your fucking hand

[Skit: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
"Oh, hey Jon."
"Oh, hey."
"How's it going, man?"
"Oh, I'm alright, whate- whatever."
"Did you-did you hear about that party?"
"No, no, no, where's that?"
"Dude. I-I... is it 26 and P or-or what?"
"Dude, it's-it's L."
"What?!"
"Yeah."
"Dude, I've been driving around for like, fuckin' half an hour."
"I thought you were picking me up right now."
"Well, I was going to, but I had to stop at the store
And get some fucking shit."
"You had to stop at the store?"
"Well, what are we going to fucking drink?"
"Do you-do you still have the money that I gave you earlier?"
"Well, not really, because I fuckin' had to buy beer!"
"That's fucked up, man. Every time, I pick you up, and I..."
"Didn't you..."
"Spend my money on you."
"You know what? Whatever, all right. What the...
Whatever. I don't give a shit." (Ooh)
"Yeah, well, I'm still going. Are you going to come?" (Ooh)
"I'll pick you up still, but... I mean
The party's gonna be over by the time I get over there." (Ooh)
"Whatever. You know, it doesn't really matter right now because (Ooh)
You are rock solid." (Ooh, whoa)
"Rock solid?" (Ooh whoa)
"Rock solid." (Ooh whoa)
"We're both rock solid." (Ooh whoa)
"That's right." [laughing] (Ooh whoa, ooh whoa)

[Outro: Kurt Travis]
(Raise your hand!)
Raise your hand if the system has missed you
Your money ain't going as far as it used to
(Raise your hand!)
Raise your hand if the system has missed you
Your money ain't going as far as it used to

(Your money ain't going...) Raise your hand if the system has missed you
(As far as it used to) Your money ain't going as far as it used to
(Your money ain't going...) Raise your hand if the system has missed you
(As far as it used to) Your money ain't going as far as it used to

And if... (and if...)
You...persist (persist)
Oh, well (Oh, well)
I might...just have to live with it

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Still grinding teeth, trying to follow you home
I’ll stop the world, cause this plan is slow
Wait across the street in the parking lot
The tree is dead, the front door is locked
The moments I framed have cracked and crumbled
Grabbed us by the throat, then I choked and stumbled
This will never work, this will never work
Check my pulse as I swallow dirt

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
I’m cutting myself with my own morals
I never meant to write about you
(I never meant to write about you)
The one contact that I loved so much
But passing my own heart, what could possibly be within?

[Chorus: Kurt Travis & Jon Mess]
Do you think about your actions?
Do you ever wonder what the consequences are?
Your licensed M. Bison got stabbed with a five dollar syringe
Oh, the dullness of existence
Your licensed M. Bison got stabbed with a five dollar syringe
Oh, the dullness of existence
I’m dressed in white, shine so bright, hair so tight

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
And I have no sympathy for this
He needs somebody else to leech off of
(Somebody else to leech off of)
The one contact that I loved so much
But passing my own heart, what could possibly be within?

[Chorus: Kurt Travis & Jon Mess]
Do you think about your actions?
Do you ever wonder what the consequences are?
Your licensed M. Bison got stabbed with a five dollar syringe
Oh, the dullness of existence
Your licensed M. Bison got stabbed with a five dollar syringe
Oh, the dullness of existence

[Breakdown: Jon Mess]
Prescribed the throat, I need the antidote, it's fucking mind over matter
Prescribed the throat, I need the antidote, it's fucking mind over matter
Prescribed the throat, I need the antidote, it's fucking mind over matter
Prescribed the throat, I need the antidote, it's fucking mind over matter

[Bridge: Kurt Travis]
My concepts are rested and manifest in ways you can’t forget
My concepts are rested and manifest in ways you can’t forget
My concepts are rested

[Outro: Jon Mess]
If you're gonna wear the uniform you better sell the cookies
Don't come to my house asking for a handout
If you're gonna wear the uniform, sell the fucking cookies
Don't come to my house

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
I drink the blood of the fortunate ones
Collapsing their teeth right on top of their tongues
Innocent children are asking for blow
All of my sources say you oughta know

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Take out the stitches
Rip off the clothes
Green light is on
Tell me what you know
Run for your lives
Judas survived
Christ version anti
Open the blinds
People outside
Ready to die
Is it July?
Take out the stitches
Back off the bitches
Me and my friends
Who has the time?
Been in line since yesterday

[Verse 3: Kurt Travis]
Alone in this place, and I feel comfortable
I seem to always hold on for too long

[Pre-Chorus: Kurt Travis]
I always hold on too long
I always hold on too long

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
When we are, it complicates and oscillates
Between fear and bravery, is it inside of me?
When we are, it complicates and oscillates
Between fear and bravery, is it inside of me?

[Verse 4: Kurt Travis & Jon Mess]
Run for your lives
Judas survived
Christ version anti
Run for your lives
Judas survived
Christ version anti
Run for your lives
Judas survived
Christ version anti
Raping and drinking is fine
Blow my face off
Blow me off
Back off the bitches
Pull out their stitches
Needless to say, I'm blank

[Verse 5: Kurt Travis]
We are all freaks, living in recession
If we don't move on, I'll forever be stuck

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
When we are, it complicates and oscillates
Between fear and bravery, is it inside of me?
When we are, it complicates and oscillates
Between fear and bravery, is it inside of me?
When we are, it complicates and oscillates
Between fear and bravery, is it inside of me?

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
From the crawlspace under the floor
Turned away from your front door
I'm in your memories
I'm in your memories
Don't turn your back on me
I'm part of what you used to be
Don't turn your back on me
Don't turn your back on me

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
You fly along the stratosphere
Forget the people that brought you here
You fly along the stratosphere
Forget the people that brought you here
Shimmy, shimmy my way down underground
Got a lot to do
Got a lot to lose
Shimmy, shimmy my way down underground
Got a lot to do
Got a lot to lose

[Bridge: Kurt Travis]
I'll always treat you well
But you won't accept the change
I'll always treat you well
But you won't accept the change
I'll always treat you well
But you won't accept the change

[Chorus: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess]
You fly along the stratosphere
Forget the people that brought you here
You fly along the stratosphere
Forget the people that brought you here
Shimmy, shimmy my way down underground
Got a lot to do
Got a lot to lose
Shimmy, shimmy my way down underground
Got a lot to do
Got a lot to lose

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I'll save your ass a thousand times
Put your body bag inside of mine
I'm back on top of a fucking cloud
The big bang is so goddamn loud
Run the play man, run the play
1969, 2012 today
Moonwalking in my leather shoes
I don't have a fucking clue

Part 1: People You Know

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Someone please!
Please write a script that's made for me
That appeals to people listening to this CD
I got a wish, I got a wish
That all of this was something special
I need a drink, I need a pill
No wait, I was over two years sober
But this guy, he said that I was on drugs
I should give some money to that bitch
Or I could just get a real fucking job

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
I am a prick, look at me go
I can get lucky playing some shows, I'm a bitch
I'ma go get some new expensive shit
Oh man I hurt
Emotions they suck
But I'll just tell people, "I don't give a fuck about that shit"

[Break 1: Jon Mess]
Ain't nobody fucking with me, man
Ain't nobody fucking with me

[Verse 3: Jon Mess]
Rancid is the sound of my voice
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces
Singing along with their dying concern
Rancid is the sound of my voice
Croaking its drama across an orchestra of friendly faces
Singing along with their dying concern to my bullshit

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Where did our honor go?
I think I know
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties
Where did my money go?
I spent it on blow
You know that I fucked all my homies' ho's
Where did our morals go?
I left them in Cabo
My parents can pay for the abortion, you know
Who has a plan?
We hold out our hands in hope for a free ride to successful endeavors

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck
The weak are the liars, the strong think too much
I am too cynical to say I don't give a fuck

[Verse 5: Jon Mess]
I need money
I need clothes
I need women
I need blow

[Break 2: Jon Mess]
Something is very fucking wrong

[Verse 6: Jon Mess]
Resting your head on your best friend's sister's shoulder
Your mother's job is to fuck all your neighbors
Bodies thrusting to the beat of our shame

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Where did our honor go?
I think I know
We've all been fucking each other in bathrooms at parties
Where did my money go?
I spent it on blow
You know that I fucked all my homies' ho's
Where did our morals go?
I left them in Cabo
My parents can pay for the abortion, you know
Who has a plan?
We hold out our hands in hope for a free ride to successful endeavors

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Give my regards to all you shady fucks
Thorn in my fucking side
Loyalty
Honesty
Trust
Respect
Humility
Sincerity
We are all so full of fucking shit
We are all so full of fucking shit

Part 2

[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
Clever girl
You've got me in your hands
You write everything down
No one turns you around
Reckless love
I see the willow tree
It's weeping for you and me, for you and me
Oh reckless love

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Uneasy hearts weigh the most
Oh, uneasy hearts they weigh the most
Uneasy hearts weigh the most
Oh, uneasy hearts they weigh the most

[Verse 2: Kurt Travis]
Maybe I could find a place for you
With all the things you do
I have no clue what to do
Lately I have been hoping to
Think of what to say
What a day, going far away

[Chorus: Kurt Travis]
Uneasy hearts weigh the most
(Uneasy hearts, they weigh the most)
Oh, uneasy hearts weigh the most
(Oh uneasy hearts, they weigh the most)
Uneasy hearts weigh the most
(Uneasy hearts)
Oh, uneasy hearts weigh the most

I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing

No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
By now you know that I am cold
Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down
And now I'm found
Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Duck down, then hide behind the file cabinet
Duck down, then hide behind the file cabinet, down
And without ever letting go I knew you'd fallen
Duck down, then hide behind the file cabinet
Duck down, then hide behind the file cabinet, down
And without ever letting go I knew you'd gone astray
Stranded here in this cold atmosphere
Waiting for the lifeless words to come from your mouth
Enduring every sound

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
This is not why the cast is hollow
Sending the rats to follow under the weight of all these eyes
Fry

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
By now you know that I am cold
Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down
And now I'm found
Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
I'll lay without understanding
I don't know why I feel this way
Oh, lay down, girl, take my world
I know why I can't see your face
I've placed every mole there is to place on your wasted body
Oh, lay down, girl, and take my world
I know why I can't see your face

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
As the window, left shattered now
We saw the withered body try to shout
You thought the price of your life was devout
And told us some things you can’t live without
And was this what was best for us?
And was this what was best for us?

[Verse 5: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Rest where you ought to be)
Just let it show (Block out your misery)
I’ll bring you far (Wait for the call)
(You left in the hallway)
Well, I’ll go for it
(People, they change)
I’ll beg you when you know (And I would still be ashamed)
I’ll beg you when it shows (To let the weight of the world)
Well, I’ll go for it (Rest on your shoulders)
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
And I don't believe the lies
I don't believe the lies
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
I’ll die for you
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
And I don't believe the lies
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
I don't believe the lies
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
It’s staged for you
(I’ll fight until the war is over)
(I’ll fight until the war is over)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Left at my feet rests the soul of my brother
Vengeance will fall for the deeds of another

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
I threw out the word the second we met
Cordial lies, I tried, I was cashing a check
The ink was smeared, the lines were drawn and scribbled unclear
A cancellation, it’s time to learn to fly
I threw up a word the second we met
Couldn't have lied, I tried, I was cashing a check
The ink was smeared, the lines were drawn and scribbled unclear
A cancellation, it’s time to learn to fly

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Now that I've decided that you can’t be
Now that I've decided that you can’t be trusted
Now that I've decided that you can’t be
Now that I've decided that you can’t be trusted
Now that I've decided that you can’t be
Now that I've decided that you can’t be
And one by one (Wasn't that fun?)
This party dies (Fade away)
Late night phone calls that end in surprise
I can't believe you would give up your dignity (Fade away)
Just to take a ride with me
And how does it feel to be used?
Climb in the back seat like luggage

Whores don't trip, they bleed on the tapestry
Whores don't trip, they bleed at the bar
Whores don't trip, they bleed on the tapestry
Whores don't trip, they bleed at the bar

[Break: Jonny Craig]
It’s your persistence that makes me sick
It’s not the sight of you
And now I am so faint, caught up in us this way
I know that you can be more than this
This wasn't what I wanted, you said I sewed that dream alive
Climb farther into hate, is it this back seat making you itch?
Morals become something from a dream
This isn't the way to blow off steam
It’s all in your head

Give up, this is making me sick
My patience is wearing thin
I will be leaving you now
Stay away for long

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Drag his body down to the mill
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
Cut the ice with counterfeit bills
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
I'll take my share
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
Like lightning bolts that strike down in pairs

[Bridge: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
This is all justified, this is all justified
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
Step aside and watch the lie
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
This is all justified, this is all justified
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
Won't heal in time
Stationed wit, I believe will go there
This is all justified now

[Outro: Jonny Craig]
And now we’re all afraid to see why we can’t give it up
But now your shirt comes off
I need something more tonight than your word

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Dressed in time to sip the wine and cover your head
Nice of you to stay a few and bleed on my bed
People flake, they wake and bake, forget what you said
Obviously, not possibly, you didn't take your meds

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig,  Jon Mess]
And here we go, climb
I got a house with a pool and a dog with a three car garage
And now come home for all these ways to, ways to go
All the way down

Cut out the signs, come inside
Where we lined up all these fashions
I’ll take your wine, just take this side
Into the light, arms are wide only when you know

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig,  Jon Mess]
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear I can’t believe its you (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear I can’t believe its you (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Lipstick, wet painted faces)
I fear (Of people with no regrets)

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Slit her throat on the frying pan
You caught a cold and forgot the plan
Turn the dial on the oven
Until the skin has got that even tan
Slit her throat on the frying pan
You caught a cold and forgot the plan
Turn the dial on the oven, man
Until the skin has got that even-

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Dressed in time to sip the wine and cover your head
Nice of you to stay a few and bleed on my bed
People flake, they wake and bake, forget what you said
Obviously, not possibly, you didn't take your meds

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig,  Jon Mess]
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear I can’t believe its you (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Nice tie, meet my concubine)
I fear I can’t believe its you (She’s not drunk, it's enthusiasm)
I fear I can’t believe its you (Lipstick, wet painted faces)
I fear (Of people with no regrets)

[Outro: Jonny Craig]
Oh, what?
Come into the light, oh

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Caught between one thick line
I can never see in the dark
Can you see at all?
Can you see at all?
Can you see at all?

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And now you go
Slip me the Vicodin, this world is upside down
Night at the symphony, the bar is closing down
And now you go
Slip me an antidote, empty the cashbox out

And now you go
Slip me the Vicodin, this world is upside down
Night at the symphony, the bar is closing down
And now you go
Slip me an antidote, empty the cashbox out
I don't want you

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And I don't know why
And I don't know why I fight for you this way
Fight for you this way, fight for you this way
Take the call and quickly lie about
Who you've been seeing lately
Then forget about it all

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Stage lights are burning on, running faster to this spot
Stare at empty faces torn from all these places
That I won't go

Mace yourself, blame someone else
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself, blame someone else
It's okay, no one will believe you
Blame someone else, mace yourself
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself, blame someone else
It's okay, no one will believe you now

[Bridge: Jonny Craig]
And I believed you're not okay
And I won't go far
And I believed you're not okay

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And I don't know why
I don't know why I fight for you this way
Fight for you this way, fight for you this way
Take the call and quickly lie about
Who you've been seeing lately
Then forget about it all

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Hey girl! You’re the best!
I’m a sucker, maybe I should fuck her now!

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Sit down, call off the cavalry
I'm stealing the jewels, slow motion action replay
Bar fight, I invented chivalry
Notch in my bed post, slow motion action replay
Sit down, call off the cavalry
I'm stealing the jewels, slow motion action replay
Bar fight, I invented chivalry
Notch in my bed post, slow motion action replay

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
Now the fog is rolling in
Bringing us that much closer to a senseless end
Oh, please don't get up, I'll get that for you
It's selfish to say I'll believe when I believe all these lies
And long enough

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Don't just lie on the ground, son
Don't just drown in the fountain)
And I don't know you, I don't know you
(Don't just lie on the ground, son
Don't just drown in the fountain)
And I don't know you, I don't know you
(You got stuck preaching action
I fell down using tact, son)
And I don't know you, I don't know you
(You got stuck preaching action
I fell down using tact, son)
And I don't know you, I don't know you

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Bring back the fire tonight, all of these lies that I uphold
(Don't mind them, they can't elope
Leave them off of the great big boat)
For one good note
Bring back this fire tonight, all of these lies that I uphold
(Don't mind them, they can't elope
Leave them off of the great big boat)
For one false hope
One false hope

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig]
Go on and fix your tie and just lead the line out
Needless to say, I stumble, you play all night long
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Bring back the fire tonight, all of these lies that I uphold
(Don't mind them, they can't elope
Leave them off of the great big boat)
For one good note
Bring back this fire tonight, all of these lies that I uphold
(Don't mind them, they can't elope
Leave them off of the great big boat)
For one false hope

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Now you'll find, as I rewind, now you'll find - not the point
Now you'll find, as I rewind, now you'll find - not the point
Now you'll find, as I rewind, now you'll find - not the point
Now you'll find, as I rewind, now you'll find - not the point
One Love

[Chorus 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
People, they look at you
Do you think, do you think of food?
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
People, they look at you
Do you think, do you think of food?

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Stretch yourself (Carving out your lungs with a stake)
As far as this will go (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)
All night (Carving out your lungs with a stake)
Follow when I row (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)

[Chorus 3: Jonny Craig]
Hey, is that your lady? She gave it willingly
And hey, wait, I've got the parts!
(To fix your head, to fix your head, to fix)
She gave it willingly
Hey, wait, I've got the parts!
To fix her head, fix her head, fix her head

[Verse: Jon Mess]
Wait right here. I'm going to explode
Wait right here, I'm exploding
I've got to be in your car
I'm still shooting even par

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Stretch yourself (Carving out your lungs with a stake)
As far as this will go (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)
All night (Carving out your lungs with a stake)
Follow when I row (Brontosaurus tracks, relax)

[Chorus 3: Jonny Craig]
Hey, is that your lady? She gave it willingly
And hey, wait, I've got the parts!
To fix your head, to fix your head, to fix
She gave it willingly
Hey, wait, I've got the parts!
To fix her head, fix her head, fix her head

[Chorus 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
People, they look at you
Do you think, do you think of food?
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
(Something's wrong, something's wrong)
People, they look at you
Do you think, do you think of food?

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Take the car and turn it into our alibis
Discard the body, pop some pills and you'll be fine
Purge, then binge, restart and insert the sutures
Turn off the lights, I'm watching Back to the Future

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Before we go too far I won't let you take this light
Before we go too far I won't let you take this light
(Cause we laughed at assimilation)
Breathe in all mistakes without coming clean into hobbling faith
No one I wanna know
(Go on and brush me off
Brush me off, brush me off
Waltzing right into the bank)

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Is this surreal tonight?
We'll go for all this rain
Is this surreal tonight?
I'll go far and I'll ride
They said that you have got a map of my insides
Purge, then binge, pop some pills and you'll be fine

[Break: Jonny Craig]
Moments fade
We have come to place these hands on your braids
Coming, the wind
He is alive, I have opened, now know

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Remove the ribs if you can't lean sideways
Stay back from light
I thought my words would have mass appeal
Costs your life, sly as always
Stay back alone
I thought my words would have mass appeal

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Cover your eyes, I've stabbed you in the back
You stop this, I can't, please stop me
Right here, I won't do this again
I can't do this, I love you for all of this shit
Why? Why? Help!

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
Sunrise
Wake up, stand up, look into red eyes
Stayed up all night thinking of reasons why
I can't feel your skin
Is this plaguing your brain?
Is this plaguing your brain?

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Couldn't brace yourself in the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird, I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learn to heal, will take time

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Close the hatch and lock the fuck ups inside)
Now breath in wide, I'll forgive you later
(Close the hatch and lock the fuck ups inside)
No yawn this time, just let your side
And all these reasons I, I am reaching wide
I am sticking to all these one-liners
And all this means, and all I have to say

You say let's go with one word
Because I, I can see what you taste like

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
Cut off these ties through the ceiling
We were holding to one night
Breathe in without love
Hear me form these lines
Forever I, I have been reading lies

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig]
Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

[Chorus 1: Jon Mess]
Couldn't brace yourself in the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird, I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learn to heal, will take time

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing
I don't even get the movie
Cold ice feels so soothing

[Chorus 2: Jonny Craig]
Watch this turn to dust
I won't know when you've fallen
Now it all takes shape
I won't go until you follow

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane
I don't feel anything, stuck in the passing lane
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch
Break, wait, stop, back off the bitch

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Block out the sound of the police beckoning
Duck in the back and the lights will shut off again
You can go for it, just don't ignore it
Ration the wine, laughing in revelry
You can go for it, just don't ignore it
Caution, I'm drugged, well, here comes the symphony
The rapist gives god a hug

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Hey girl, I'mma eat your soul
I got this sword, dashing, young and bold
Let's collect hearts on the way
Plus two, to you, in the evil bay
So, hey girl, what should we do?
Get clues, drink some potions that are blue
Well, you know, there just isn't time
I don't got the time, I don't got the time

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Oh, look up, girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd)
Oh, look up girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd, I'd be the bitch, but I left you, I left you in the ditch)
(Right now I'd)
Oh, look up girl, show me what you have to use
(Right now I'd be the-) Oh, look up, girl

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Bite the line, remove the words that follow)
This battle's narrowing
(Turn the key or in the mud you wallow)
Hold off, I surrend my stand
(Burning bushes may be cold as shoulder)
So gone, one door
(Flip the latch, go on and catch the boulder)
Can't fake now, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go

[Spoken Word]
"All of those who took the road before you
They were possessed by the dark power
But you... you shall do this alone
As you walk through valley of the gorgonian tempest
The tri-elemental black darkness was engulfing the sovereign lands
'Use the +9 Staff of the Bobcat', a voice said from above
Defeat the demon of Rathcorf and you shall restore peace to the land
And the lineage of your blood"

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Step back, let go
Get back
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
One night I woke (Say one more line)
With all these hopes (Stay for me)
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Say one more line
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
Stay for me
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
One night, I woke, (Say one more line)
With all these hopes (Stay for me)
(Step back, let go, step back, let go)
Say one more line
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
I believe there's meaning
No, I believe there's nothing
Stay for me

Starving your envy
Feeding off faith
Well I am cold tonight
I am afraid

We're all scared of something
Just don't run from me
I'll follow you always
Until you give in

[Intro: Tilian]
Sometimes ain't nothing what it seems
Feel like we're living in a dream
And nothing's ever guaranteed, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Tilian; Jon Mess]
They say they have the answers, we say they're full of shit
They got lots of pretty fangirls, rather be celibate
Keep all your precious banter, we're chasing hella rich
They do it for the front page, just for the hell of it
I've eaten thousands of my words like bees
Then ignored stinging sensation and enjoyed the feast
With arms wide open and you're taking me high
If it's technically creed, I won't stop you

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
River, you look so far from way up
Down below, they live for a tunnel
We're compelled to follow (Oh)

[Chorus: Tilian]
Tunnel vision (Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa-oh)
Stuntin' on mountains (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tunnel vision (Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa-oh)
So stuck trying to blow it up
Forgot you know how to climb

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Dress, text, breakfast
Rhino died, got new T-Rex
Gratitude from battle wounds
We're not dead, but we could be soon
Soon, soon, soon

[Refrain: Tilian]
Sometimes ain't nothing what it seems
Feel like we're living in a dream
And nothing's ever guaranteed, oh-oh
We'll likely end up on our knees
Best thing we did was evergreen
We'll never find out what it means, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge: Jon Mess]
They're gonna try to turn you into a bastard
On your way to financial bliss
In the hands of the impotent masters
Cum inside the bottomless pit

[Verse 2: Tilian]
They say they have the answers, we say they're full of shit
They got lots of pretty fangirls, rather be celibate
Keep all your precious banter, we're chasing hella rich
They do it for the front page, just for the hell of it

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
River, you look so far from way up
Down below, they live for a tunnel
We're compelled to follow

[Chorus: Tilian]
Tunnel vision (Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa-oh)
Stuntin' on mountains (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tunnel vision (Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa-oh)
So stuck trying to blow it up
Forgot you know how to climb

[Post-Chorus: Jon Mess]
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Trying to blow it up
Dress, text, breakfast
Rhino died, got new T-Rex
Gratitude from battle wounds
We're not dead but we could be soon

[Outro: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Forgot you know (Forgot you know)
Forgot you know (Forgot you know)
Forgot you know how to climb
(We're not dead, but we could be soon)
Forgot you know (Forgot you know)
Forgot you know (Forgot you know)
Forgot you know how to climb

[Verse 1]
My friends and I have parted ways
You  know I love to make mistakes
I'm  a disaster no one's laughing

[Chorus]
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow  will be yesterday
The  worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No  one around to judge
Judge what I've become

[Verse 2]
I got nobody left to blame
No hopeful trust for me to break
Been  dying faster, no one's laughing

[Chorus]
Goodbye
The memories will fade away
Tomorrow will be yesterday
The worst is yet to come
At least I'll get there all alone
No one around to judge
Judge what I've become

[Bridge]
Be my bruiser‚ trust me I'm a loser
You're a classy lady‚ how'd you get so bad?
I'm unruly‚ tie me up and school me
You've got privilege, baby, how'd you get so sad?
And you can love me‚ hate me
Just don't try to save me
Call my name and drag it through the mud
Love me, hate me
Go on try to break me
Go on try to break me

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Past and present are fleeting, gripping me
Nothing sections, wasted, infection, and breeding
Squashed and filed away, vacant collapsible piece of time
Squashed and filed away inside my mind
Suspended moments stored
Stored and left unread

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Was I ever a child before?
Was I ever a child before?
I bore, the burden and bear the gift, and spread the sore
Was I ever a child before?
Was I ever a child before?
Banal, stripping layers, an invisible coursing war

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
A slave to believe in always looking back
Nothing has beaten meaning, based on fact
Fatal blow, fatal blow indeed
Fatal blow, fatal blow

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Was I ever a child before?
Was I ever a child before?
I bore, the burden and bear the gift, and spread the sore
Was I ever a child before?
Was I ever a child before?
Banal, stripping layers, an invisible coursing war

[Outro: Will Swan, Jon Mess]
Tethered, resent me
Tethered, resent me
Tethered, tethered
Tethered, resent me
Tethered, resent me
Tethered, resent me
Tethered, resent me

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
Start out as something beautiful
Hold out for something unreal
But don't hold your breath
Because I'm all that's left
Say that I've gone
So you walk away

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Well I was once willing to admit you're perfect
But now the words they stutter off my lips
Well I was once willing to admit
You were perfect, perfect

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
And all my dreams
Hold out on my knees
Hold out, I'm all in
I can't bet, I can't win
Save it all for the end

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
Hey! And now
Let's all pretend you didn't want to go down
Hey now!
Let's all pretend
Save it all
Pretend you didn't want to go down
Hey now! Let's all pretend

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Well I was once willing to admit you're perfect
But now the words they stutter off my lips
Well I was once willing to admit
You were perfect, perfect

[Intro: Jon Mess]
B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S
Will you bless this mess?
B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S
Will you bless this mess?

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
Simple angel, perfect devil
Can I come inside?
I'm feeling like larva
I'm frumpy like Martha
A 15-foot Parka
I grow out my clothes
Eat till I'm sleepy
The muffins are beefy
A giant diamond
When you're blessed, it shows

[Chorus: Tilian]
You wanted me to act up
To make you feel more backed up
Well, take a swig of vodka
And battle underwater
You say you need a father
Well, baby, I'm a baller
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh

[Refrain: Jon Mess]
B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S
Will you bless this mess?
B-L-E-S-S-T-H-I-S-M-E-S-S
Will you bless this mess?

[Verse 2: Tilian]
No rehash, no rehab
No empty simulation
I want it, I made it
It's not an animation
Got no time for depression
No therapy session
Inertia, it festers
And feeds my aggression
These chains on my tires
They came with it, they're stock
My sense of direction is all the way up, up

[Bridge: Tilian]
Keep up, keep up 'cause I'm not coming down
I'm jacking up shots, you can fight for the rebound
Got an angel and a devil seducing my head
I'm in for a three-way I'll sleep when I'm dead

[Chorus: Tilian]
You wanted me to act up
To make you feel more backed up
Well, take a swig of vodka
And battle underwater
You say you need a father
Well, baby, I'm a baller
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh
I won't ever grow up, oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Tilian]
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na

[Refrain: Tilian]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian & Jon Mess]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

[Chorus: Tilian]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Refrain: Tilian]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place
Where you said?

[Chorus: Tilian]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Verse 3: Tilian & Jon Mess]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
When the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to surrender
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one

[Chorus: Tilian]
I want something else
To get me through this
Life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

[Refrain: Tilian]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Outro: Jon Mess]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we would start out lives

[Refrain: Tilian]
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
(I want something else)

[Verse 1: Tillian, Jon Mess]
I followed, making flirty faces, rounding out the bases
So you'd borrow me for the night, maybe for life, whoa
Endorphin orphan morphing, lemon cheese equally
You know my origin story, born in the cemetery
I'm into stupid apps, like 'cry-yo-own self back to sleep'
My rock is solidbucks, these people ameniti-ties
Must have you misunderstood, little girl, you're a dangerous lady
Just because it feels so good, that don't make
That don't make you my baby

[Chorus 1: Tillian]
Fed me Skittles on a burial ground
Gave me rabies in the back of my car
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar

[Chorus 2: Tillian, Jon Mess with Will Swan]
Get another round of weirdo in 'em
Turn around slow and rear your head
No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha
Now you're just another scar
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Now you're just another scar

[Verse 2: Tillian, Jon Mess]
Only on occasion do I lose my patience
I just swallow all of my pride, but I can't this time, oh
I test this cable, I plugged into a tree
I play the tokin' tone from straight off the leaf
I got the smoothest roots that spew out the feet
There's a clue in a plant and it can bite off the teeth of disease

[Chorus 1: Tillian]
Fed me Skittles on a burial ground
Gave me rabies in the back of my car
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar
Shoved that dagger through the back of my heart
Now you're just another scar

[Chorus 2: Tillian, Jon Mess with Will Swan]
Get another round of weirdo in 'em
Turn around slow and rear your head
No one allowed to solve the riddle, ha
Now you're just another scar
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
You're just another

[Outro: Tillian, Jon Mess with Will Swan]
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
You're just another
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss my- kiss your ass goodbye
Kiss your ass goodbye
Just a little scar tissue in the back of my heart

[Verse 1: Tillian]
Nostalgia, we used to lose ourselves in conversation
Nothing was final, we used to brace ourselves for separation
From time to time I find myself wondering what could be
If I'd never been to hell before I built a shell

[Chorus: Tillian, Jon Mess]
The pussy vultures are coming for your girlfriend after you break up
They listen to her sad story then slip it in when she's vulnerable
Don't think it won't happen to you
My best friend said, "Hey Jon, screw you"
Now I'm confused, I don't know what to do
So don't think it won't happen, it won't happen to you

Can't send a postcard
From the future to the past
Can't warn your own self
That these memories fade too fast
And when it's over
You can't recreate the past
My mind is an ocean
Wish I built a bigger raft

[Verse 2: Tillian, Jon Mess]
Stuck inside all these distant memories
Was supposed to start a family with you
I keep trying to hold it all in my head
Convince myself that I still love you
But you're never coming back
And this pain is all I have to hold you
And it's fading out too fast
And I can't make it last anymore

Until I can't crave it at all
Until I can't forget it existed
Until I can't crave it at all
Until I can't forget it existed
Impossible to say, just how long we'll be waiting
We'll hide it all away, to keep our love from running out, out, out

[Bridge: Tillian]
Nostalgia, we used to lose ourselves in conversation
Nothing was final, we used to brace ourselves for separation

[Chorus: Tillian, Jon Mess]
The pussy vultures are coming for your girlfriend after you break up
They listen to her sad story then slip it in when she's vulnerable
Don't think it won't happen to you
My best friend said, "Hey Jon, screw you"
Now I'm confused, I don't know what to do
So don't think it won't happen, it won't happen to you

Can't send a postcard
From the future to the past
Can't warn your own self
That these memories fade too fast
And when it's over
You can't recreate the past
My mind is an ocean
Wish I built a bigger raft

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Drenched in your blood, this crime's overdone)
And you wait for this world to come down
(Step down and back away)
Because you know you're wrong
(Drenched in your blood, this crime's overdone)
(Step down and back away)
And you wait for this world to come down
(Drenched in your blood, this crime's overdone)
(Step down and back away)
Because you know you're wrong
(Drenched in your blood, this crime's overdone)
(Step down and back away)

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And now you are so ashamed
(Step inside to candle lighting at the fireside)
To see that I have made it farther than you ever will
(Take your time)
(D-D-D-Dinner won't be done in time)
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
You speak of riding wings
(Just keep your distance)
Such talent wouldn't be entrusted to such little kids
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
(Just keep your distance)
And now I beg for him
To let you go, to let you go

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(It seems like thievery)
You wait for us to say
(Doused in, doused in dye)
Why you're here and burning flesh
(It seems like thievery)
Is all we hope to accomplish
(Doused in, doused in dye)
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
While you wait for us to say
(Just keep your distance)
Why you're here and struggling arms
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
Is all we hope to accomplish
(Just keep your distance)

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Oh, I'm so flattered
(Stand in line roll call is where the liars died)
To see you copy
See you wish that you could be just like us
(Take your time, the sinners will forget their lines)
(Doused in, doused in dye)
(Doused in, doused in dye)
(Polymorphic hemophilia is fine)

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well tonight you burn for this
Red can, blue flame, I will
Watch you burn from every corner of this place
And I will see you squirm with pain and fate
Try to breathe with sulfur in your lungs
Try to breathe with smoke in your lungs
(Make your own damn bed)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(It seems like thievery)
You wait for us to say
(Doused in, doused in dye)
Why you're here and burning flesh
(It seems like thievery)
Is all we hope to accomplish
(Doused in, doused in dye)
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
While you wait for us to say
(Just keep your distance)
Why you're here and struggling arms
(Here's some sex for all these whores)
Is all we hope to accomplish
(Just keep your distance)

[Outro: Jon Mess]
It seems like thievery
It seems like thievery
It seems like thievery
I've been doing back flips off the doorway to the cellar, man
I've been doing back flips off the doorway to the cellar, man

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
Parts of victims organs
They will give you better style
Attach the platemail to your insides

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Blistered by the fire
(Keep your victims confined)
Caught in the threshold
(To meager rations)
Man the armory
(Rations)
Dressed in our
(Those in your basement)
Last attire castle walls
(Keep them confined to meager rations)
Falling down around us all
(To meager rations)
(To meager rations)

[Pre-Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
And then when you go to sleep
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
I hope you wake up knowing
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
That you were meant for all of this
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)
(I stashed the platemail under the file cabinet)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
First, take time to breathe, you don't need me
(We can't go wrong)
You don't need anything, it's a wonder
(Just hand me the best tongs)
How we're all under attack from everything always
(Paid our dues and now we're gone, now we're gone)
And I'm willing to die to save your life
(We can't go wrong)
I know that you feel the same towards me
(Just hand me the best tongs)
This is the last thing you'll remember
(We can't go wrong, we can't go wrong now)

[Bridge: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Lance her eyes and take one of those dream vacations)
You're saddened to see
(Lance her eyes and take one of those moonlit ocean walks)
Everything you've loved so far is falling
(Lance her eyes and take one of those dream vacations)
Right into reach, but you're still scared of this rain
(Lance her eyes and take one of those moonlit ocean walks)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
First, take time to breathe, you don't need me
(We can't go wrong)
You don't need anything, it's a wonder
(Just hand me the best tongs)
How we're all under attack from everything always
(Paid our dues and now we're gone, now we're gone)
And I'm willing to die to save your life
(We can't go wrong)
I know that you feel the same towards me
(Just hand me the best tongs)
This is the last thing you'll remember
(We can't go wrong, we can't go wrong now)

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Wear parts of victims organs
They will give you better style
Parts of victims organs just lance her eyes
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments
Blood stains my blade from taking hearts as ornaments

[Intro: Jonny Craig]
You roll your eyes to say the least, I'm all alone
And I feel that you can't be a part of this

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
(Remove sprockets from the machine
Cross wires, touch down)
And now you run for
(Lights out, put out the fire
It's right now, it's a white sound)
These empty lights and these empty waves to fall away
(It's a transcendental toothache you'll be feeling for miles)
(Be just like a battery might try, might lie)
(While you're breaking the waves)
Such empty lies that you would say
(Take a break for a second)
(Take a break for a second)

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Can you take this line?
(Words don't write themselves)
And how you run away from this place
(Wine, dine, lie and wait for falling bombs)
(Chloride and salt intake)
Dry your eyes, bleeding's inside
(Chloride and salt intake)

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And I feel such defeat, such broken lies in your home
And I feel such pain from those beautiful brown eyes
(Might try, might lie, recent definitions)
And you reach for those words to wait in line
(Two in the back)
(Like a bird in flight, son, try to fly a kite)
And I feel such deviance leaving you now
(Son, take him by the hand, push him in the sand)
Can you taste this blood?

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And how you run away from this place
(Wine, dine, lie and wait for falling bombs)
(Chloride and salt intake)
Dry your eyes, bleeding's inside
(Chloride and salt in-)

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And you wait, and for this meaning to leave
And you take, so breathe with love
And make those feelings last
Now dry your eyes
You might have done it, fund it

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
This hits too close to home for me
And I don't need to be reminded of this pain
I dwelled so long on the possible changes
Every step forward was a fall towards your demise

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Jonny Craig]
The secret lives of wives
And you beg me
Please don't go tonight
And I beg you
Please just come back down

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig]
To earth to build this trust
In which we have learned
To recreate

[Chorus: Jon Mess & Jonny Craig]
The secret lives of wives
And you beg me
Please don't go tonight
And I beg you
Please just come back down

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
Your pride won't let you ride
And you said
When will you give it up
I won't fail
I'm not leaving
You and me
And this will fall
How will we get it back up

[Verse 4: Jon Mess]
And I thought this candid smile was worn down
Lying to suit the mood shop for ties to hang myself with

[Verse 5: Jonny Craig]
And you say this ended in arrogance
Caused by my vanity
Oh where will you be
Well maybe you just looked too hard
Or maybe I don't look enough
Who will decide your fate?

[Verse 6: Jonny Craig]
How will you align this with love?
How will you end this with glory?
Oh and don't let this go
And don't let me go
Just let this down

[Outro: Jon Mess]
Stricken close to the heat
And I'm biting a line burn in the wheat fields
Shop for ties to hang myself with

[Verse 1: Jonny Craig]
Said it's the coming of man and I forget when you went away
Like a kick to the face, not winning the race
Lion, I've seen you from afar, win, this is your car
Knowing that you deserve such more
Deserved to know you're free

[Verse 2: Jon Mess]
Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector
Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well, then you said that you could do this on your own
Well, I'm sorry, baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You, well, now it's up to god to save you

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Save you from all of those bruised and battered wounds
(Wave right with a gun in his hand, wave right)
Can you taste this blood dripping sweeter than...?
And over your eyes, and I, and I fall to both knees
Not to beg for your forgiveness, but to hate the word
And you speak

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Take a right off these cliffs
The ground is staring at your wounded weapons
Wounded weapons (And I don't believe that you're right)
You can bank the night on this
It's round and glaring at your well
I get hyphy, tell 'em, I get hyphy
And this is where it ends

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Well, then you said that you could do this on your own
Well, I'm sorry, baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You, well, now it's up to god to save you

[Bridge: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Save you, save you
Save you, save you
I can't believe these long words come from any national loss, or
This is a line, cuts across hope, defeat, the line, the loss
I can never be this long word
You can never see me across this earth
This will be a line that I run from
You thought you were so strong
You pleaded to never be wrong
(Brace yourself, fasten belts)
Well, now that you're gone
(Close the hatch, flip the latch)
I sit here and wonder
(They're not dead, speed ahead)
Times have changed, it's like we've been trashing silos
Well, now that you're gone
In the time-bomb aisle
I sit here and wonder
Maybe they'll dodge the spill
Oil kills, sure it will
And I can't breathe the air
(Hide your daughter, 'cause I'm coming over)
To reach for this light
(You know I'm not lying about)
(Trashing silos in the time-bomb aisle)
And you can't breathe the air
(About trashing silos in the time-bomb aisle)
Not leaving her to reach
The line, the work, the rope, the love

[Outro: Jonny Craig]
And I have seen such worse for you
It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back
And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's 'cause he's gone
And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's 'cause he's gone
And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's 'cause he's gone

[Verse 1: Jon Mess]
And they would follow you home
Until we wind up dead, checking your pulse
She'd wait across the street under our tree
Outside the front door
In autumn's blind embrace
But you wouldn't let her anyway and we run

[Verse 2: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
And we framed these moments
Today your dream is dead
Til one remaining cold calculated thought
And when you wake it won't be there
And we framed these moments
Today your dream is dead
Til one remaining cold calculated thought
And sew that smile up with threads
And we framed these moments
Embrace this hope and let it flow
Til one remaining cold calculated thought
You fool

[Verse 3: Jonny Craig]
Too shy to know your worth
Hurt from insensitive behavior
You're scared of what this really is
And where this might lead us next
And don't let me go, I feel it
And don't let me go

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Prescribe the drug
Prescribe the drug
That's how I feel about love
Try to sleep, try to sleep
Here I go
That it's not worth it
Prescribe the drug
Prescribe the drug
That's how I feel about love
Try to sleep, try to sleep (breathe)
You're not dead

[Verse 4: Jonny Craig]
And in failure dreams fall
Pushing nightmares over pavement
Walking the streets, living victim
Writing death threats in the wet cement
You'll say that I will lie
And end it with this life
You won't regret my love

[Chorus: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
Prescribe the drug
Prescribe the drug
That's how I feel about love
Try to sleep, try to sleep
Here I go
That it's not worth it
Prescribe the drug
Prescribe the drug
That's how I feel about love
Try to sleep, try to sleep (breathe)
You're not dead

[Outro: Jonny Craig, Jon Mess]
My goal was to make you happy at your best
You'd noticed all of this meaningless, I destroy you
Even through the only things that I have left for your
Condescending eyes looking at each other's
White lies, my heartache is useless
So quickly we'll address the shadows running from light
It'll take this breath, denying what is left of us
Crying, crying under pressure
Crying, pressure, crying, pressure
Crying under pressure, pressure
Embrace this [?]
If you could just wake up tonight (Tonight)
I'd be with you under the sky (I'd be with you under this sky)
With you tonight (Drink up, drink your blood, drink your blood)
